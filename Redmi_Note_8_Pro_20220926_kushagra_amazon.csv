0,A great budget phone for Manual Photography and Gaming,4,"Here's my full and honest review for those who wanna buy it:It's kind of hard to get the features it gives in such a small price range. It surpasses most phones in similar price range, for following reasons:1. The CPU. Even though it uses Mediatek chip (which is cheap and inferior to Snapdragons), it runs all of its 8 cores on stable 2GHz, not like others which have 2 cores running at 2.5GHz and rest of the 6 are at 1.5. Better buy the 8GB RAM version to get the most out of it, because This Mediatek chip somehow performs at par (or even better) than Snapdragon processors that come within the similar price range. However, it doesn't always run at full speed, but only when needed. This gives some problems like occasional lags when quickly opening high-memory apps while phone is in calm mode for too long.2. Liquid cooled: Again, for this price range it's amazing. However, you need to keep the phone covered with plastic case (comes in the box) to make it work flawlessly. It's because the heat from your hands can easily get transferred to the inside fluid and interfere with convection currents that keep the phone cool. Using a plastic cover helps insulate it.3. Multiple Antennae: The 3G/4G cellular reception on this phone is so good that you're practically never out of signal in the areas where most people struggle to get a single bar. Although it's aimed for gamers who need stable connection for online gaming, it's a big boon for everything else. Wifi/Hotspot works way better than any other phone.4. Large battery, Out-of-Box Fast Charger and USB type C: Again, for a phone this cheap, it's a steal. Battery lasts VERY long because they didn't just pump this phone with fast CPU and large battery, but the way this phone handles everything is actually very efficient that gives you smooth experience while keeping the battery running for long. There are some noticeable glitches though, like sometimes phone takes a while to go from battery-saving to full performing mode and that creates lags. But thankfully, those lags aren't uncommon even in most expensive android phones, so for this small price, you should live with it. Because your other option for total zero lag free experience would be to spend 10x money and buy the iPhone 11, and once Apple releases new iOS, that will start lagging too.5.  Cameras: This phone has 5 total cameras. While most of them weren't necessary and are uselessly overhyped, the main reasons to buy this are:  a.) The color/contrast you get in the final clicked picture of 16MP that combines the data from multiple sensors - this is unmatched and you'll love the pictures shot in regular photo mode.  b.) The pro mode with manual controls (32-sec shutter @3200ISO) for main camera and stable lens focus (even without OIS) - best for astrophotography. MacroLens works best in Pro mode where you can get nearest focus for some very detailed microscopic shots. You also get other stuff like metering control, pocket mode where it locks screen while still recording, peak overlay to show you what's in focus and what's not, timelapse with control over intervals [manual controls don't apply to front camera, and for other two sensors, shutter speed is very limited and final pictures are very blurry and have no detail whatsoever at ISO higher than 400. the camera app is native to Redmi software and doesn't support timelapse in manual mode; and other apps like CameraFV-5 don't work so well with bracketing/timelapse... proshot doesn't work at all. you can shoot timelapse in native app but then you won't get manual controls, which is useless for night]  c.) All sensors are larger than usual phone sensors, which means better details in low light in all modes [but it doesn't mean they all capture good detail. the macro lens gives worst images and ultrawide isn't any good at all if you want detailed images. only the main sensor with its pixel binning does the actual job]  d.) 1080p@120fps and 720p@240fps video encoded in x265 - fast and efficient [rest of slowmo modes are low performing, misguided and not very useful. 960fps mode is there, but it captures only 4 seconds of footage, with the 960fps slowmo applied only to the last 1 second - you have to time your shot very precisely to get it right. there's no sound alert for when it will begin slowmo. also, it isn't native 960fps, more like 480fps with merged frames to make it look like 960fps - capture very fast moving objects like shooting an arrow from bow, or vibrating guitar string and you'll get the artifacts that make it look so fake and ugly]  Still, there are things where Redmi could have utilized their budget somewhere else - like Macro lens and Ultrawide aren't very practical. Not just for this phone, but they aren't practical in most phones (Ultrawide gives you wider view but distorts the periphery and people in edges), and in this phone, both Ultrawide and Macro lenses use low-res sensors (2MP for Macro and 8MP for UW), and they aren't good in low light, and even in full daylight they give much lesser detail and color/contrast than the main sensor. and the 64MP's full 64MP don't look any good when zoomed in to 100%, so don't expect to get sharp images from small sectors of a full 64MP photo. But it helps create a very sharp and detailed 16MP photo by combining pixels from 64MP sensor with data from other two cameras, which is kinda better than most expensive phones can do. Also, separating foreground from background is done VERY good (probably because of its AI-learning and 4-camera depth information - works well for front camera too). It can even separate individual hair strands in some cases if lighting is good and subject doesn't move - which is at par with what iPhone 11 Pro does with 3-camera unit.6. Operating System and functions: Usually the custom-Android builds kind of tarnish the performance, but that isn't the case with this phone. Here's what I liked about it:  a. it gives the freedom to use your own launcher homescreen app (which many other custom-UI Androids don't provide).  b. The gaming mode is one of the best things about it - when playing fullscreen games like PUBG/ClashOfClans etc, you can swipe a corner and use Whatsapp/Facebook and Browser in small sidebar like area without leaving the game! even keyboard turns into short, floating version to help typing while keeping the game under eye. There is also a neat option to turn off display while keeping the game running without locking your phone.  c. You can record the screen while gaming (which is fast and doesn't stress the system performance while recording) [but during the recording mode, the audio get desynced from what's going on in the game. this also happens if you connect wireless headphones or cast the screen to your TV/monitor. but this isn't a RedMi issue. it happens in every device when you record/cast audio or video wirelessly]  d. Fingerprint sensor works flawlessly, there are no mismatches so far as I've used. Hope it stays that way.  e. Native call recorder in calling screen which records both your voice and caller's voice in neat detail (unlike most phones where you can't hear other person in recording unless they're on speaker)Final Verdict: A great phone to have for this price. It isn't just a cheap phone because price is cheap. It's actually a good device with good battery and smooth performance everywhere. There are some areas where RedMi could've done better instead of putting four cameras, but then again you're getting what other phones can't give you even at double the price so I shouldn't be complaining about this at all. :)",Uday Singh, 31 January 2020
1,good,4,product is very good i bought it just when it was launched try to go for colours other than black. i personally like black color but for this phone maybe the green color is more suitable looking. one big problem i faced is that after just few months battery was not able to hold the charge like it did at the start almost everyday i need to charge it and i don't even play games rarely some calls and just checking my whatsapp if with these very few tasks the battery life is this poor i don't know what will happen if someone wants to play games. but the main advantage is phone is quite hard doesn't even have a scratch even after falling on roads so many times like one of those old nokia phones. so if you are not playing regular games only want it for big screen and doing a few tasks then its a good phone,Siddharth Das, 5 September 2022
2,The Apple of Your Eye,5,"The Redmi Note series has always set the bar when it comes to the mid-range smartphone territory.And once again, as an overall package, the Redmi Note 8 Pro is competing in flagship level territory, especially when it comes to the specs.*Design - 5/5*The glass sandwich design makes the phone feel elegant and subtle unlike the tacky metal Redmi Notes of old. The Note 8 Pro has a sturdy heft in hand and doesn't feel very unbalanced in weight distribution. One handed usage is not exceptional, since it is a pretty big phone. The camera lens array looks well designed on the back and the White Colour variant looks really good. My pick would be the Gamma Green variant however, it really is something else. Buttons are a non-issue, and I particularly like this placement over Samsung's way. I do not see the need for the text ""64MP AI Super Camera"" on the back however, but it is barely visible. The included case is very good quality and a boon to have.*Display - 4/5*The LCD is display is vibrant and bright and does not suffer from the dullness issues that used to plague Xiaomi phones in the past. The screen is terrific for everyday usage as well as Media Consumption. My only gripe would be that it still pales in front of the AMOLED display on the Realme XT which has much more vibrant colours and battery efficiency.*Performance & Specs - 5/5*There are really no complaints when it comes to specs. 6gb of RAM at this price point is simply a godsend and the USB-C port means this phone is 2019-ready. The Mediatek G90T SoC is a good performer in most day to day tasks and can handle heavy games at acceptable frame rates if you drop the settings down. It might be a bit worse than Qualcomm when it comes to open source work however, such as GCam ports and Custom OS's. The Haptic Motor is predictably bad.*Battery - 5/5*The 4500 mah battery eeks out almost 7 hours of Screen on Time on standard usage. Add to that the included fast charger in the box and this competes in flagship territory.*Camera - 4/5*The camera array here is definitely the best out there in this price point. It is insane how these mid-range smartphones can have a quad camera array while Google is still struggling to include two. The key difference between more competent camera phones and this however, is consistency.While shots in the day time generally look excellent with good amount of detail, the Note 8 Pro often produces excessive noise in darker areas of the shot such as the highlights. Once the available light starts to go down, the more noise it produces in shots with the back camera - such as in the sky and in leaves of trees. But these shots are mostly - perfectly usable for social media.What rectifies some of these issues is the Night Mode. Once Night Mode is used, the photos are generally more detailed and have much less noise.Portrait Mode is generally very good.The Telephoto lens works well, but the Ultrawide struggles to find focus and produces soft, sometimes hazy images. It is a tough angle to get right.The Selfie Camera is very good. Switching off beauty mode works as expected and it shows good detail in human subjects. Skin tones are also fairly accurate and not too white.There are a billion modes and the whole Camera UI can seem a bit overwhelming with the amount of features it has, some very stupid ones to boot. Video quality is good and the slow mo features are very nice to have. Super Slow Mo is very difficult to get right though and was a chore to time properly. Xiaomi loses some points for this cluttered Camera Application that has pretty lame stuff like filters, which you can anyways apply later within an editor before posting.*Software - 3/5*The Achilles heel of the Redmi Line - MIUI. There is a lot of bloatware that gets preinstalled onto the phone, which thankfully, can be uninstalled. MIUI has ads all over the place - please go through the setup process carefully and disable the user experience program to get rid of some of the ads. There is an article by Android Authority that can help you get rid of all the ads in MIUI, but it would be nice if we didn't have to deal with this in the first place.No App Drawer, everything plopped onto the home screen in typical Apple Fashion. I was not a fan of this and installed Nova Launcher at the first opportunity, which worked without a hitch.There are microstutters and jitters and lags occasionally across MIUI, not so much once Nova launcher has something to say about it.The Settings Menu is confusing and suffers from poor translation. It lacks polish and the options are often poorly organized and overwhelming. While MIUI is chock full of features, it is slow to get updates and probably won't receive any more updates after Android 10.  The Gesture Navigation right now is not upto par with Android 10 fluidity and polish. If you buy this, you can't really be thinking along the lines of frequent updates and bug fixes.Also, I could not get the Haptic feedback to work on GBoard, which is the default keyboard. This seems like a bug and is not nice to experience Day 1.To Conclude - All the negatives listed are honestly nitpicking at what is a very good device at this price point. Xiaomi has indeed redefined what 15k brings you these days in Smartphone market. Suffice it to say that this is the Apple iPhone for people who still have two healthy, intact kidneys.",pSyDuck, 13 December 2019

17,"Redmi Note 8 Pro (Shadow Black, 6GB | 64GB) - A Camera Beast - Gaming Powerhouse",5,"Redmi Note 8 ProDESIGN  -  Solid and Well built, Front & back Gorilla Glass 5 protection with curved edges. The camera bump at the back protrudes a little even when the cover is on, may be a matter of concern. Please look for a Silicon cover to protect the camera module.PROCESSOR  -  This houses the newest chipset from MediaTek Helio G90T which is basically designed for gaming. This not only helps the phone to load & play high graphic intensive games fast & smooth, but it also helps in quick loading and swapping of Apps in a day to day usage. The overall performance is amazingly fast and buttery. Those who are complaining of heating issues, should buy ACs before buying phones for playing games for hours..STORAGE & RAM  -  This comes with the fast UFS 2.1 onboard storage that help load apps ultra-fast, as compare to old eMMC 5.1 type storage. The basic model starts with 6 GB LPDDR4 RAM with Dual Channel Enabled. This helps increase the bandwidth by double the data rate as against the single channel RAM. Everything loads amazingly fast with no lags as such.Supports up to a whopping 512 GB of storage with a dedicated Micro SD Card slot. This is what we want in every phone…DISPLAY  -  6.53” IPS LCD Panel with 395 PPI density and 2.5D curved edges. This display is of a 1080 x 2340 Resolution with HDR Enabled so the colors look very vibrant and true to life. The water drop notch looks very nice and it can be disabled from settings. Personally, to me the display looked very crisp and sharp. The brightness of this display can go up to 430nits which is very bright and display looks amazingly sharp and crisp… 4k HDR video quality on YouTube is amazing on this display...CAMERA  -  This is where it exceeds all other phones. The default 12 MP Camera takes nice pictures in all modes. The 64 MP mode can be enabled from the camera app and it captures amazing pictures with great clarity colours and contrast. The pictures with 64 MP camera come out to be very crisp and with lots of details. But the image size for 64 MP camera would be approximately around 15 MB per picture. This can record the videos up to 4k Resolution. However, Full HD videos will have an Electronic Stabilization enabled by default which produces great videos. Macros also come very crisp considering that this is a Mobile camera but, not the DSLR.Front 20 MP Camera also captures wonderful selfies with lots of detail. This can record videos up to Full HD resolution. This phone does a great job in Camera department. This will surely satisfy your hunger for great pictures…Those who are looking for Gcam support, should take mobiles that support it or should buy google phones instead of complaining about this phone. The company has offered a good package with great camera and it does a wonderful job. People who are looking for an astonishing clarity Camera then they should look for a DSLRs or buy flagship phones.Attaching few pictures for reference…CONNECTIVITY  -  Supports Dual 4G VoLTE on both SIM Cards simultaneously. Dual Band Wi-Fi that increases both Upload and Download speeds dramatically if connected to Wi-Fi 5GHz connection.Comes with Bluetooth 5 with LE (Low Energy) mode on that helps preserve battery drain..BATTERY  -  A Whopping 4500 mAh Battery with Quick Charge support.VERDICT  -  One Word – A Monster in all aspects, be it a Design, Style, Battery, Display and Camera. Except its weight of 200Gms, this is one piece of art and technology that nobody wants to miss having it…Every product will have their own issues and bugs, including flagships that can be fixed with a software update.  And every product cannot be compared with another since everything has its own existence and importance.Thanks to Amazon for safe packaging and fast delivery…",Sarkhazi, 8 November 2019

24,Average,3,Not good mobile,Mobin, 21 September 2022
25,Value for money,4,"Probably the best phone in this price range. Pro's and con's are as follows.Pro's : 1) Powerful Mediatek Helio G90T. No less than a flagship processor. You can easinly play all high end graphics games without any lag on high settings. PUBG Mobile is buttery smooth on HDR + ULTRA frame rate.2) Camera : Primary camera performs well for the price range. 64 Megapixel works perfectly but struggles in indoor lighting conditions. Selfi camera performs well.3) Battery : 4500 mAh battery works perfectly. Device gets full charged from 10% within one hour given conditions that internet,wifi,bt should be turned off and device not being used while charging.4) finger print reader works fine. It will work 8 or 9 times out of 10. For me, it even forks if I have a bit moisture on my finger.5) Build quality : Corning Gorilla glass 5 works exceptionally well. I've accidentally dropped my phone from 3 -4 feet height a couple of times without back cover and it didn't get a single scratch.6) AI mode in camera app gives you best results most of the times.7) Design elements : I think this is relative term. Few people will like the design and some may not. I personally like it.8) IPS panel with hdr+ works very good. Viewing angles are great.Cons:1) Wide angle camera is only usable for properly lighen up places. Low light conditions add huge amount of colour noise. Macro camera is of no use at all. Atleast for me. Picture quality is poor. They should've given zoom lens instead of that.2) HEATING ISSUES : they have mentioned it comes with liquid cool technology but I personally didn't feel any use of it. Device gets heat up near upper left corner on the back side while heavy usage.3) Device gets heatup quickly while recording 4k or 60 fps videos. After recording for 15 mins (Not continuously) in the afternoon it got heated up and system restricted camera operations due to overheating.It gets heat up while playing games on high settings as well. But I am glad it doesn't affect performance but sometimes it becomes really uncomfortable to hold the heated device.4) Game turbo : Game turbo works fine but it has a major issue. It comes with a game dnd but I don't know why it doesn't restrict popup notifications. It doesn't even has an option to turn off pop-up notifications while playing games. If you're using 3 or 4 finger claw while playing pubg, you'll atleast once or twice accidentally tap all those annoying pop-up notifications while playing game.5) Face Unlock : Face unlock works fine but has an issue. It unlocks the phone even if you're not looking in the camera. This should be fixed in an update asap.6) No regular updates : No wonder it comes with MIUI so, you have to get used to late updates. I've brought this phone in the December last year, now it's june and it still has December security patch, didn't receive any updates.7) Comes with bloatware as usual in all Redmi phones.Overall device has given me good results in past 6 months of usage. I would say it WAS a value for money device when it was priced ₹14,999. Now the prices are increased by around 1.5k, it's still a very good price for this device but 1.5k is a huge price hike.",kaushal, 2 June 2020

30,just short of perfect,4,"after using more than 10 days. the honest review is here lets talk in points and i will try to give you every answer1 built quality- excellent quality and looks great but it is bit heavy becouse you will definately use a case with this phone otherwise you will feel risk .without back cover looks great and will not feel heavy and another thing is that camera is quit out from body so there are chances of getting scraches2. sound- you will miss dolby sound. the sound is good and moderately loud but dont expect the great3. performance- thats where it beats the all. i dont think you will find that kind of performance upto rs 20-22000 mobiles. absolutely class4. PUBG- pubg lovers if you want a phone specially for pubg dont let thsis phone go .excellent gaming5. heating issue?- only if you use this phone for long time with continous gaming.and with high graphics. otherwise no issue even you watch a full movie with wifi. only while gaming after one hour on full hd graphics6. display- butter smooth display quit large and excellent display best in claass but will not produce colours as super amoled just a littel bit of diferrence between the two  but you will not find much differance in day to day life . so full marks for display7. battery- i will say a decent battery life considering 6.5 inch display and a a heavy processorcamera?- this is the biggest of alll and i am giving you a detailed review for this. camera is superb no doubt even in low light it performes vary well and after zooming the photos you will not get blur images at all. potrait mode is one of the best in this segments .but now the cons of cameraslow motion and wide camera are poor. vary poor quality i am not impressed at all. slow motion video you can capture only from short or close distance otherwise not good at all and even you cant shoot in artificial lights is well. and wide camera does not produces good quality pictures. macro camera is excellent.and the last con of camera i compaired this camera with iphone xr and vivo v15pro . in terms of details it is totally equall to them but colours of the pics is not that great but decent in comaprison you will find colours bitt dull but that does not mean they are better . they only produces better colour otherwise same. but one thing to notice both iphone and vivo captures the colour more saturated than orignal even they dont produces real colours. redmi shows littel light colours than real and xr iphone and vivo littel dark than orignal .camera is vary good and you will get good pictures and for colour you can adjust them with some photo editing. so no issues. final verdict on camera is .that it is a good camera and you will not be disspointedworth the money you spendgreat display good camera good battery good built qualitylittel heavy, sound lacks dolby quality.camera slow motion and wide angel not goodi will say only compititor for this phone is Vivo z1x in this price segment.you can buy any of this phone depends on your demands",Amazon Customer, 7 November 2019
31,The Redmi Note 8 Pro is powered by the MediaTek G90T gaming processor.,5,"Redmi Note 8 Pro Specifications:6.53-inch full HD+ (1080p) display | MediaTek G90T octa-core processor | 6GB or 8GB RAM with 64GB or 128GB storage with expandable storage support up to 512GB |  64MP main camera + 8MP ultra-wide + 2MP macro + 2MP depth camera + 20MP camera | 4500 mAh battery with 18W fast charging | MIUI 10 with Android Pie (9) |Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: CameraThis is the part which Xiaomi is hyping up, given there’s a 64MP camera out here. The automatic resolution is 16MP. The camera produces bright photos with accurate color tones, even at night. The selfies are impressive on this phone, and it creates a nice depth in Portrait mode, though it is not all perfect with edges on the hair.Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: Performance, batteryGames like Asphalt 9, Badland, Nova Legacy all ran without any hitches. I switched Asphalt 9 to high graphics settings and the phone had no problems handling it. The graphics looked smooth without any lag. In regular usage, be it just browsing on social media or using the phone to edit photos to keeping 20 tabs open on Chrome, the experience was smooth.The only issue I noticed, the phone also got warm around the top when gaming for too long. On the battery front, the Redmi Note 8 Pro has a 4500 mAh battery. The 18W fast charger ensures a full charge in under two hours. With moderate usage, you can go up to two days on this phone, while heavy-duty usage means around one and a half days on the device.The Redmi Note 8 Pro runs MIUI 10 based on Android Pie. Xiaomi has said it will get MIUI 11 by the end of December. It does come with Alexa pre-loaded, though Google Assistant is there as well.Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: Design, DisplayThe Redmi Note 8 Pro has a curved back design, though this is a broad and bulky device compared to the previous variant. One reason is the bigger battery. Redmi Note 8 Pro also has a bigger display at 6.53-inches, with the full HD+ resolution. The curved back means it is easier to hold this with one hand, but the size of the device might not always make it possible.The positioning of the fingerprint sensor right at the bottom of the camera module is not ideal either, because you will end up touching the lens like I did and covering it with smudges. The macro camera is placed away from the other three sensors to the right with flash on top of it. The idea here is to let people use flash to add more light when using macro shots.The display on the Redmi Note 8 Pro continues to be one of the best for its price. It does come with Widevine L1 certification you can stream content at HD or full HD on YouTube, Netflix, etc. The viewing angles are good, and this is a sharp display, which works well in most scenarios.",Abhiishek Mohta, 9 November 2019

40,This is an in depth review of this phone after using it for 18 days,5,"I bought this phone on first sale which was on 21st October and got it on the same day by paying 100 Rs extra for fast delivery and today after using it for 18 days I am writing this review So who ever want to buy this phone please read this this is an honest reviewPros:-1:- Helio G90T processor is great as it is pretty fast and makes phone snappy, you can play pubg on hdr and ultra fps or smooth extreme fps no lag so far and no heating many people were saying it heats a lot and all that stuff but in reality my phone doesn't heat and i play for min 2-3 hrs daily on smooth extreme and i play with cover so it explains everything that the liquid cooling in it works really well and there is no heating issue2:- It has a massive 6.53 in HDR 10 enable display which is pretty big and the bezels are too thin you can see only screen and the touch response is great in this phone while Playing games like pubg, COD etc overall screen is great.3:- It comes with quad camera setup the picture taken with it are great and the 64 mp camera does a great job with details and its potrait mode is great too, the wide angle camera does a really great job and takes a great field of view and the macro camera actually works and click some really awesome images and video recording is great too you can record 1080p 60fps with stabilization and slow motion upto 960 fps you can also record videos on wide angle camera and macro camera and the selfie camera is good too it takes overall good selfies in low light too and natural images no artificial beautyfy no skin smoothing crap like oppo, vivo and realme.4:- Battery life of this phone is great i get nearly 12 hr of screen on time and it includes 2-3 hr of COD 3 hr of YouTube and all social media apps like instagram, WhatsApp, twitter, facebook, taking photos, and watching Anime on Chrome for 2hrs and shopping apps like Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Club factory etc for 1-2 hrs and i am done for the day still 1% remaining and it takes 1hr 30min to charge from 1 to 90 and I will recommend you not to charge phone over 90 % as it is good for battery health in long term and the above data i told you was from 100-1% battery to get the perfect screen on time.5:- Fingerprint scanner is pretty fast and reliable and face unlock is great too as it's fast and accurate.Sorry I can't put pictures i clicked from this phone as they are all personal and private pictures.Cons:-1:- Because of the HDR10 support the videos on YouTube seems a little whiteish and it annoyed me at the start but I am used to it now.2:- It takes 30min to charge from 90 to 100 %3:- The camera bump is too much you can't put your phone on floor on backside or you will get scratch on your camera lens.4:- The Helio G90T processor is based on 12nm technology so it's not that battery efficient and for now it has no Google camera support if it would come with Google camera support in future the photos will be on next level.Those are the only  cons i found till nowThank you.",Sanjay R., 10 November 2019

42,This phone has survived a waterfall,5,"This phone has been a part of my life for more than three years and it's been worth every penny. When it arrived with a clear case, I put it on and the case now is a little yellowed but does it's job just fine. This phone has fallen down on the road, out of a rickshaw, bounced off surfaces and fallen to the ground and even survived a waterfall for over five seconds on a trip. I had pulled it out to take a picture and thought haha thank god I'm clutching on to my phone tight, it falling in the waterfall would not be good at all and lo and behold, it plunged straight into the water. My inital reaction was of shock and then panic which explains the five seconds. I thought, when I pulled the dripping phone out, that it definitely wouldn't work and it had finally gasped its last breath but this miracle of a phone worked without a glitch, no sweat. Definitely buy.",neeti c., 9 May 2022

44,Pretty decent for a midrange phone.,3,"It's a good medium range phone that I've been using since 10 day so my review is based on this time frame.I was using a Samsung s9+ since 2 yrs and still use a redmi note 4 as a secondary phone  since almost 4 yrs. While the red. I note 4 has been working super well The samsung AMOLED screen developed problems within 2 yrs and  repairing was costing 50% of the cost of a new phone. For this reason I didn't want to spend akt of a new phone a d the Note 8 pro fitted my price - features ratio budget well.The note 8 pro uses an IPS display as compared to the newer series of redmi and other brands which use AMOLED. AMOLED though is a better technology as far as displays are concerned but it has too many flaws and shortcomings. Just Google AMOLED issues on phones and you will see...Coming to the redmi note 8, below is what I liked / disliked...Pros:- product feature - price ratio is good. You get a good bang for the buck you spend.- fingerprint sensor and face unlock feature work flawlessly and have a quick response-battery life is pretty good. Works almost a day and a half.- screen touch flow and response is very smooth and effortless. Obviously this is due to a combination of a good screen, Screen sensor and software- infrared sensor is a very nice feature to still have in a phone today to control your gadgets- built in Alexa is also helpful and easy to setup-The halo white color looks nice and different though it's more of a light blueish tinge than white.-processor is also pretty fast. Didn't find any lagging with higher end games though I'm. Mt a avid gamer and didn't play for too long. Some. People complained about the phone getting hot after playing PUBG etc after a 15-20 mins.-camera quality is decent and while you cannot compare to a higher end samsung like my s9+ but it's good for the price you pay. It does disappoint in low light and night but. Kst low to. Wdium budget phones have this issue. The wide and ultra wide settings in the camera pro mode do a pretty decent job. MACRO shots are pretty OK top.. Not one of the best but passable. Ironically the note 8 pro has a better camera and video output than the newer note 9 pro / pro max. Another reason why I went for this earlier model.Cons:- The built in speaker output is not the loudest. Some other phones in the same budget sound louder.-battery charging could have been faster. 1.5 hrs for a full charge is not the fastest but it's good enough.-too much built in extra software / bloat ware is not a good thing. In some of these we can't even switch off ads.-for a medium price phone headphones and screen guard should have been provided",Sam Sam, 27 July 2020

50,Redmi Note 8 Pro : Your Typical Redmi Note Gets A Premium Makeover,5,"1)Thus, the Redmi Note 8 Pro happens to be Xiaomi's first smartphone with a 64MP Samsung sensor, a 'gaming-oriented' MediaTek Helio G90T chipset powering the device instead of the usual Qualcomm mid-range chipset, and a battery unit that has been increased to 4500mAh.2)That said, the rivalry between Xiaomi and Realme has picked up frantic pace over the course of 2019, with both companies trying to outpace the other at every step. Having been the brand that has stood at the summit of India's smartphone market for eight straight quarters, the company certainly doesn't want to lose out relative newbies.3)Realme, meanwhile, is breaking records of its own, gaining a market share of 9% within just 15 months of existence. So does the Redmi Note 8 Pro do enough to warrant the spotlight for yet another iteration? Read on to find out.,Build and Design4)The Redmi Note 8 Pro is hands-down the most attractive looking Redmi Note series phone till date. It's striking but not over the top and that's precisely why I've loved how Xiaomi's gone about the design here. It's also worth noting that Xiaomi's typically been a brand that doesn't revise their product designs often enough. They changed that with the Redmi Note 7 Pro earlier this year and eight months down the line, they've changed it up again: this time, adding it a little more oomph to the mix.A Good Display That Could Have Been BetterOn the front, the Redmi Note 8 Pro gets a 6.53-inch FHD+ IPS LCD panel. The screen itself is seemingly identical to what Xiaomi fielded in this segment earlier this year, and you get decent colors and zero issues with sunlight legibility. But when you pay attention to competition though, namely, the Realme XT, you do get an AMOLED screen that has more vibrant colors.The reason why the comparison between LCD and OLED comes up every time is because black levels and contrast aren’t exactly as good on an LCD panel as the AMOLED screen on the Realme XT. However, the difference in quality isn’t huge either. The panel on the Redmi Note 8 Pro is just as good as LCD panels get and if you're someone who streams a ton of video content on your phone, you'll definitely have a great experience.Redmi Note 8 Pro: Performance and SoftwareXiaomi definitely raised eyebrows when they decided to go with a Mediatek SoC in the Note 8 Pro despite the Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 doing an excellent job in the Redmi Note 7 Pro. In fact, it was a big risk and the scales could have tipped either way. But as it turns out, this was a brilliant decision on Xiaomi’s part as the Mediatek Helio G90T delivers every ounce of muscle you'd expect from it and more. This is by far the most powerful on any phone priced under INR 17-18,000, one that certainly caters to all the PUBG-walas out there.Redmi Note 8 Pro: You Didn't Need To Throw In Four Cameras In There XiaomiRear:64MP f/1.79 Primary8MP f/2.2 Ultra-wide angle lens2MP Macro Lens with focus upto 2cm2MP depth sensorFront: 20MP f/2.0 Selfie shooter",BK, 7 November 2019
51,"Normal user's mobile. ""Ok"" not ""superb""",4,"After one month of usage writing this review as a normal mobile user ( am not a photographer, gamer, techie)Pros:1. Fast charging. in 4500mah its charges quite fast. i liked it2. Selfie camera was good3. Rear camera, portrait mode was good. Manual adjustment of blur is good. AI camera option is there4. Battery life: For normal use (only watsapp, youtube, small games, call) its coming around 1 and half days.5. Fingerprint reader, face unlock works really fast.6. 128gb and expandable is superbOther than this all common things are there no need to mention that.CONS:1. Since it is 6.5 inch its looks too big in hand. For small hand people it will dificult to handle , handling top notification clusters is quite difficult.2. Lock, vloume button : Reaching those buttons with fingers is difficult. It will take time to used to it3. 64mp camera didnt give any impression looks like  normal pic only. ( Realme XT camera was too good, i have compared photos of these two devices)4. 960fps slow motion video is for 10 secs only and u cant edit5. In camera app, orientation changes not happening fast. You have to shake 2 to 3 times to get correct orientation.6. Call sound was too high person who sits near u can hear .7. For heavy user batter will drain fast because, for 6.5 inch mobile 4500 mah battery not enough. Daily u have to keep for charging.8. It is 200g after u put covers and all it will increase a bit so it feels heavy in your hand. also in pocket.9. Gallery app i hate. after watchng a video its difficult to come to grid page. also Back-home button not appearing so easily so you have to mess up with it sometime.10. Mostly am using in one handed mode. In Full mode when i use watsapp fingers got pain. In one hand u cant reach top of the mobile so easily.11. Built in alexa voice capture is not clear.12. Mainly....... i didnt have much data since its my new mobile. i didnt install much app. i faced mobile hangs for some time. It took time to open camera app, closing some other app. What is the use of 6GB RAM.Verdict:Before i was using REDMI note 4. i tot of going for Samsung M30s, but last minute i bought this. I have to compare with note 4 only, so for me Its ok to buy but dont expect wow factor here reg battery, performance, handling, camera. For look wise its good but still if we put cover no looks matter here. Go for it if you are a normal user.",Thala Rasigan, 4 December 2019

57,It's Aweeeeeeesoooooooomeeeeee!!!!! ¡!!!!!!!!!!!!,5,"Redmi Note 8 Pro Specifications:6.53-inch full HD+ (1080p) display | MediaTek G90T octa-core processor | 6GB or 8GB RAM with 64GB or 128GB storage with expandable storage support up to 512GB | 64MP main camera + 8MP ultra-wide + 2MP macro + 2MP depth camera + 20MP camera | 4500 mAh battery with 18W fast charging | MIUI 10 with Android Pie (9) |Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: CameraThis is the part which Xiaomi is hyping up, given there’s a 64MP camera out here. The automatic resolution is 16MP. The camera produces bright photos with accurate color tones, even at night. The selfies are impressive on this phone, and it creates a nice depth in Portrait mode, though it is not all perfect with edges on the hair.Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: Performance, batteryGames like Asphalt 9, Badland, Nova Legacy all ran without any hitches. I switched Asphalt 9 to high graphics settings and the phone had no problems handling it. The graphics looked smooth without any lag. In regular usage, be it just browsing on social media or using the phone to edit photos to keeping 20 tabs open on Chrome, the experience was smooth.The only issue I noticed, the phone also got warm around the top when gaming for too long. On the battery front, the Redmi Note 8 Pro has a 4500 mAh battery. The 18W fast charger ensures a full charge in under two hours. With moderate usage, you can go up to two days on this phone, while heavy-duty usage means around one and a half days on the device.The Redmi Note 8 Pro runs MIUI 10 based on Android Pie. Xiaomi has said it will get MIUI 11 by the end of December. It does come with Alexa pre-loaded, though Google Assistant is there as well.Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: Design, DisplayThe Redmi Note 8 Pro has a curved back design, though this is a broad and bulky device compared to the previous variant. One reason is the bigger battery. Redmi Note 8 Pro also has a bigger display at 6.53-inches, with the full HD+ resolution. The curved back means it is easier to hold this with one hand, but the size of the device might not always make it possible.The positioning of the fingerprint sensor right at the bottom of the camera module is not ideal either, because you will end up touching the lens like I did and covering it with smudges. The macro camera is placed away from the other three sensors to the right with flash on top of it. The idea here is to let people use flash to add more light when using macro shots.The display on the Redmi Note 8 Pro continues to be one of the best for its price. It does come with Widevine L1 certification you can stream content at HD or full HD on YouTube, Netflix, etc. The viewing angles are good, and this is a sharp display, which works well in most scenarios.",Pramod sharma, 2 December 2019
58,BEAUTY AND THE BEAST,5,"I am rating this product 5/5.Well, according to me, this device is a perfect value for 💰.Let's talk about each and every segment of this device. I am going to give an unbiased review as I am not a MI fan and this is my first MI/Xiaomi device.CAMERA: Pictures captured in day light( normal default mode)contain a lot of details. 64MP doesn't need any introduction. Each 64MP pic varies from 18 MB to 30-35MB in size. They have a lotta details when you zoom in. Portrait shots are awesome too.Night pics are decent too. They are above average. Not as good as Iphone 11 though, of course, but considering the price it's awesome.Macro shots are incredibly awesome. I mean you can just take a pic from 1-2CMs focal distance.ULTRA-WIDE lens serves it purpose well, but slightly fades out the colors. The pic from ultrawide in daylight are very good, but indoor lighting are not that sharp and a little bit of lack color saturation, Hope Xiaomi fix it in updates.SPEAKER: SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT, CRISP AND CLEAR. It cannot be compared with STEREO SPEAKERS mobiles like ONEPLUS 7T or S9+ but yes, considering that it is a SINGLE GRILL FIRING SPEAKER, the quality is decent and it's loud enough.NETWORK STRENGTH: NO ISSUES AT ALL. Everything works fine. No call drops, no speed issueBUT NOTE 8 PRO isn't giving me 4G+(CARRIER AGGREGATION) SIGNALS. DON'T KNOW WHY. MAYBE NETWORK OPERATOR ISSUE OR MAYBE IT DOESN'T SUPPORT INDIAN OPERATORS 4G+.4G WORKS PERFECTLY.DISPLAY: It can't be compared with Amoled or S.Amoled but I just wanna say, I simply don't care. It is bright, and colors are sharp and contrast is very good. It supports HDR+(useful only when you watch HDR content).BATTERY: 4500 MAH, is enough for a moderate user for watching videos , WhatsApp, fb etc. Will easily give you around 1.5 days with still some juice left. If you are a heavy user then it might give you 8-9 hrs backup if you use continuously.DESIGN: SUPERB. IT'S HOT. No doubt. Back is just awesome and gives you a premium feeling when you hold this phone.BUILD: The device is around 200GRAMS. It is a bit heavy, but trust me, you will get used to it. And after 2-3 days you won't even feel that it's heavy. It's just getting used to it. Positioning of fingerprint sensor is inaccurate and sometimes you might touch the 3rd camera lens above the sensor. But again, you will get used to it.CAMERA BUMP is there, so use a good quality case to protect it.PERFORMANCE: HELIO G90T+ 6GB RAM(MINIMUM), CMON, it won't show you any lags. It's buttery smooth even for gamers. Yes , this CHIPSET cannot be compared with SNAPDRAGON 855+ but still, after one level, all are decent ones.RAM management is decent too, and switching between the apps is smooth and lag free.Overall, it's an awesome device.As first customer of Xiaomi, I am happy with the device.",Vaibhav Mishra, 3 December 2019
59,Redmi note 8 pro 6/128gb Review.,5,"Loved the phone.Redmi did an awesome job with this phone.Tho at first the camara was noise and dull but after updating it to miui 11 it is really awesome i cant stop taking pics from the 64mp.Now about the performance, i would say it gives you the feeling as tho you are playing on a premium phone i played it for 6 hours straight on HDR+ with high refresh rate. The phone can handle itself well i did not face any lag of frame drops. There was heating but if you play on max setting of any phone for long hours you will face heating. The battery was amazing it lasted for 8 hrs (6hrs of high setting which left it at 5 percentage and the 2 hours of mild usage) i wiuld say the prosessor has to do a lot with powersaving as it ment for performance and saving. The wide angle camare still needs work mainly at low light image does come dark but ofcourse that some you will only notice if you do a comparison.Haptic has modes high is the best you feel life something is ticking you in the pocket when you are riding or driving. The audio was a high inprovement after the update now i can hear it from the other room. :)  There are cons like if you are swiping very fast if will detect a tocuh anywhere on the screen also when i placed my earphones on it the phone went crazy ( sadly it managed to uninstall Pubg and all i could do was watch as all my data went down the drain) but that fine i installed it again.The call quality ti good i can hear what people are saying and people can hear what i am saying so no problem there. Internet speed now that really depends on how far the tower is fron you, you will face really slow speeds.  my airtel is the worstWith speed from very good to worst.1) jio/vodaphone. Both sims have 4g active at once. So you you turn on inter on one the other won't goto 3g.2) idea tho it's part of voda now but not as good as voda3) airtel.The download speeds for jio are at 2 mb/s that what i got when i was downloading from plastore speedtest showed 10mb/s i did get 10 mb/s but after 3 to 6 am when network traffic is reduced. With voda i got 800 kb/s to 2mb/s it staded at 2mb for the most part but there were drops way more the jio.Ideo had 600kb/s  to 1mb/s that was the best i got from it.Now it's airtel with 160 kb/s to 400kb/sI was able to download buy hugh files i was just sitting and watching thr screen.You have to keep in mind this is in my area it may be defferent in your area.I hope this helps i will try to update of any changes.",jovian, 3 January 2020

61,Best midrange smartphone:Period!!!,5,"I usually don't review products on Amazon, but this one deserves special mention; so here we go..In the Box: You get handset, 18 Watt fast Charger, and a Cover, no screen guard inside the box...The cover: deserves an especial mention- it's similar to OnePlus 7 cover and has that USB flap to protect phone from water damage...The Handset: White looks almost magical; there are 2 trays side by side, which can accommodate 2 sims and a MicroSD. On the top, you will find an IR blaster, nothing new if you are a returning Xiaomi customer, but if this is your first, then just use it once and see how handy it is in controlling TV, AC and other remote control appliances...Bottom has a single speaker grill, 3.5mm Jack and USB Type-C...Switching On: It gives a haptic feedback which is quite tuned rather than the rude vibration that Redmi Note 5 pro gives, Xiaomi has worked hard to fine tune the device and it has paid well. Now starts the real torment: There are tons of options guiding you to customize the phone as you prepare for our maiden voyage and options for Ads are kinda well hidden, but more about it later.UI: Now let your eyes and mind get accustomed to MIUI; there's no app drawer and all apps are neatly grouped into folders. there's a lot of bloat, but thank the sweet Lord it's uninstallable. I would advise you to enable developer options and reduce the animations to 0.5X; the phone will be noticeably faster and less animated...Display: The HDR display is vibrant and bezels are negligible; one of the best ever seen on Redmi Note series...Camera: Of course, it's the camera phone with monstrous 64MP primary sensor; my initial impressions were good but camera tends to saturate dark colors quite a bit, and Wide Angle has quite noticeable distortion; Scared yet? Don't be cuz even after these caveats, the camera performs well specially with pro-mode; do not use 64 MP mode, the noise increases quite a bit...GCam: Here's our sweet savior again; Xiaomi has left Camera 2 api enabled, so installing GCam is pretty easy; right now, the best one has been developed by Wyroczen and you can find all about it by a single Google search; the GCam corrects most errors of he camera but do not use macro mode; it's much better on stock Camera...Speakers: The single speaker doesn't really satisfy people who've used Stereo speakers, but this fact can't take away the limelight off Note 8 pro; the speaker is loud, crisp and has a good bass due to bigger cavity...Connectivity: It is quite good and works fine; haven't seen 4G+ or carrier aggregation though...Verdict: Redmi Note 8 Pro is a fine phone with little to compromise upon; Surely a great effort from Xiaomi once again...PS: Pardon any typos.",sandeep bansal, 6 November 2019

63,Feel the premium phone.,4,"Iam using this phone since 3 week I personally liked this phone.Because in the 20k segment this phone is a beast. Iam a heavy user I used this phone mostly for gaming purpose, and also photographyLiterally i play pubg for more than 4 hours daily with the graphics settings of(HDR + ULTRA) and also with (Smooth + Extreme)In this settings I don't faced any lag. But but in (HDR + ULTRA) I faced frame drops below 15 FPS.But in the case of (Smooth+ Extreme) we can play upto 60FPS. But in some places like when we (hotdrop) mean if we surrounded with many enemys then the FPS will dropped below 45FPS.But all-over the gaming experience is good.But Also in the higher graphics setting the phone gets heated upto 40 degree that not a big problem because it will cool down immediately after putting phone idle for 2-3 minutes. So the liquid cooling helps to reduce the temperature fastly.PROS:1:The battery life of the is good if you are a light user then it will runs upto 2and a half day for a heavy user the battery will last upto 1 day.2: The design of this phone is really amazing and also in the hand it will feel like a premium phone.3: Both the front and the back is protected with the gorilla glass 5.4: This phone has a LED notification light and also it has a ir blaster which I personally liked it.5: All-over the gaming experience is smooth in this phone.6: The 64mp camera will takes a good photos.7: The front 20mp shooter is also pretty good.8: A bigger screen of 6.53 inches.which provides a better experience in gaming.9: IP52 rating for dustproof and splash proof.10: This phone has a good processor Helio G90T. The score of this phone is above 282k.CONS:1: The speaker quality is below average.2: The Brightness of this phone low.3: Company should provide the super amoled display.4: video recording of this phone is very poor.5: While gaming at highest graphics the phone will started heating.6: The camera bump is too big if we put a back case on it then also it will not cover the camera bump.7: fingerprint sensor is too small and also the placement of the fingerprint sensor is bit wrong.8: 4g connectivity support in 2019 end. This may be issue for future 5g network.",samama abubaker, 12 November 2019

65,One Year Review,5,"Guys, I am using the phone for almost a month now. First I will come to the issues I have noticed. Alexa does not work property, I am least bothered because I am not gonna use that function anyway. So my user experience is not effected. But since they hyped it so much, MI should make sure it works properly and I am sure an update will fix the issue. Second thing I have noticed is, it is not an issue, more like personal preference, though calls are clear, the volume is bit on the lower side, I wish if it was more loud. Not a deal breaker or anything.Coming to the good parts, this phone is much faster than Note 7 pro. I used 7 pro for one month before buying 8 pro. Mind you,  Note 7 pro is still a very good device. I am not a gamer, but whenever I played games in high setting, it performed flawlessly, no heating issues, no lags. I don't know what is the scenario if you play for more than half an hour and stuff.Coming to the camera, it is a stellar! It takes better pictures than Note 7 pro. Day light pics are impressive. But night light pics are okay-ish only. At night, camera struggles to focus. Camera app is not using the full potential of the setup and maybe MI can release an update to do something about it.I am not a heavy user, so I get two days battery life easily. I am very happy with the battery back up I get.My Note 7 pro had SD card reading issues at times and it is cause by a bug. I am not sure if that is rectified. I have not faced any such issue with Note 8 pro. Have not faced any bug  in UI either.So far so good and I hope it stays that way.Phone is a looker, but it attracts dust and finger prints easily. Right now the cases available in the market are just crap. I bought one from Amazon and it **s, returned it. I think I will wait for some time and more options will be available.  If you put 5D tampered glass, you can't use company provided phone case, that will make bubbles in tampered glass and in one day it came out for me.If you guys have questions, please ask.UPDATE:Using it for almost an year, no major issues other than it is a Chinese phone, considering the situation we have with China. Updates stopped coming, I don't think they will update this phone anymore. Go with latest phones. And what's up with price hike? Purchased it for  14,999.00 and ₹ 18,999.00 now? Buzz off, not at all worth for this price.",Jones A., 14 November 2019
66,Good Phone with nice camera and specs! But No support for Data Transfer,3,"Glad to be the first one to write a review for this phone! The Picture clarity in the Rear Camera is very detailed with proper light effects in case of LOW / VERY Low Light, the 64MP Option should be used when you have no worry about storage space and you know that every single Photo that you will take using this option will be 10MB+ going up to 25MB depending on the details captured in the image.The Front Camera of 20MP is also very stable and takes good images.It is nice to say that Redmi does not apply any default BEAUTIFICATION effect to your photos just like REALME does!Actually, I had purchased this phone to replace my iPhone 6s, however, I was totally dissatisfied as there is No software for any data transfer between iPhone and Redmi for that matter Redmi phones do not have any INBUILT application for data transfer from Android to Android or iOS to Android which is why the rating is reduced by 2 Points. It seems to me that Redmi has manufactured and thought of mobile phones for FIRST TIME BUYERS only! So this issue is not addressed, and maybe it can be looked into if they want to! In comparison, if you check for M30s from Samsung (similar specs and price), you get a default option of moving your data including SMS, Contacts, Photos etc without any problems from iOS or Android!About the return option and contacting Amazon / Redmi, the Customer Care at Amazon are absolutely clueless and will not say a word about the purchase, will simply ask you to contact the customer care of Apple OR Redmi (whatever are the 2 phones that you have - Old and New), the Redmi Customer Care person will say you can download the apps called XANDER etc, which are of no use and third-party apps which won't help at all in any transfer of data.Please note that though AMAZON may mention RETURN POSSIBLE UP TO __ NOV 2019, actually you cannot return the phone unless the phone is received in a PHYSICALLY DAMAGED condition which would have to be proved to Amazon by sending the Photos to them and if they think it is genuine, else RETURN IS NOT POSSIBLE!!!All in all a good phone for first-time buyers (considering the camera specs and price point), but a clear NO for migration! Also if you don't want to keep the phone or you are thinking that you will buy, check, decide and return then please note that it doesn't work!",Afzal, 6 November 2019

68,The best budget phone available. Would recommend,5,"Redmi Note 8 Pro (Halo White, 6GB - 64GB): Bought it once my Oneplus 3T had a faulty touch screen. A very budget friendly and well performing phone.Pros:1. Budget friendly. ₹15,000 is the ideal price for a smart phone. Since you get above average 'everything' at this price. Since my ₹33,000 Oneplus 3T had a faulty touchscreen a week after it's 1 year warranty expired, I learned a valuable lesson. Never buy expensive flagship phones. If I, for some reason, break this phone after warranty, I can buy the best ₹15k phone at that time and still wouldn't have wasted as much money to stay behind on technology. For instance, my OP3T is now 2.5 years old, it has only one camera which is only a bit better than the Note 8 Pro main camera (of the four cameras). I don't really miss the AMOLED display either since this IPS panel is brighter and larger that the old phone. Note 8 Pro actually performs better at games too. So, given the rate technology is advancing, I would definitely recomment a budget ₹15k phone every 1-2 years instead of a flagship for 2-3 years, so you'll have a well performing, technologically advanced phone all the time.2. Excellent display. Large, spacious, vibrant and bright.3. Excellent performance. I'd say it's atleast 20% better performing than a 2.5 year old ₹33k flagship.4. Battery is good and gives me a good full day's usage which includes moderate browsing, gaming and other usual stuffs. Also, note that the Wifi, data and Bluetooth are always left ON on my phone.5. The halo white glass back looks so beautiful and distinct. It's also scratch resistant.6. Doesn't heat up too much even while playing intensive games like PUBG.Cons:1. The camera gives a smoothened out picture even when getting the raw image.2. The Xiaomi apps are a nuisance most of the time. I intend to replace MiUI with an open source ROM soon after the warranty expires.3. Charging is not the fastest, but just fast enough. The fact that the battery lasts for a while does help though.4. This is not a deal breaker for the budget phone, but the more premium features like on-screen finger print sensor, AMOLED display, better camera are not available. So, if you are not that into gaming, I'd recommend a Redmi K series phone, which was just a few thousands extra, but worth it for the features.Overall verdict: Satisfied, does not regret and will buy Xiaomi products again and again. They offer the best hardware for any of their product category for the price, with a small compromise on the annoying ads and MiUI ecosystem.",Praveen Raj, 29 February 2020
69,Decemt Product But........Read This!!!!,4,"**Most honest review writing after full analysis of the Redmi note 8 pro.**Really decent product no issues with breakages.Quick Review✓✓1. Battery:- 4/52. Display:- 3/53. Processor:- 4.5/54. Camera:- 4.5/55. Build and design:- 4/5:=> Detailed Review  ✓✓✓1. Battery:- Uses a 4500W battery but I think the MIUI is not much optimised for the better battery life . The Drainage is really quick even without gaming. Though you get a 18W fast charger but still takes a good amount of time to charge .2. Display:- Its a Full HD screen also the display is sharp. But what disappointed me was it's standard 60hz refresh rate , Which at this price point is a necessity. The good thing is you get HDR support for YouTube.3. Processor:- The Mediatek Helio G90T is a beast for Gaming you can play Smooth + Extreme , and still this a good processor at this price point . The bad side is it starts to heat after continues gaming and also a little bit warm when using the phone for daily tasks.4. Camera:- The 64 Megapixel is good the macro camera works perfect. You have 1080p@60fps video recording also 4k@30fps supported. The slow Mo is @960fps is also quite impressive. But overall a good camera phone but not the best.5. Build and design:- The design looks glossy and good finished. The water drop notch looks a bit old but can be used. Has a shiny and pretty glass back which makes it vulnerable to scratches I hope you use a back cover. The fingerprint sensor is on the back, but would be better if it was on the power button or on screen. The thing which makes it less abstract is it's weight and with the back cover on it feels pretty heavy.Final Verdict :- The redmi note 8 pro is a good value for money phone out there and if you are interested you should buy it. But it has some better alternative which would be worth using.No Problems with Packing. No scratches or damage was found on the PhoneKindly Upvote.",Mushfiq, 6 July 2020
70,My take on the Note 8 pro,4,"Let me highlight the pros and consPros.1. Fingerprint detection is lightning fast.2. Battery life is absolutely great.3. Miui 11 is much better than their past UI.4. Build quality is top notch.5. You can use two sims plus 1 microsd separately.6. At first i was sceptical about mediatek as in the past i encountered a lot of lagging and hanging problems but this Processor the Speed and performance is the best i have ever used on a budget phone it feels like using the Snapdragon 800 series with no problems. Great job Xiaomi.7. I lost my led light controller but thanks to the infrared on this phone i can control my lights now also TV and stuff. It's a neat feature.Cons.1. If your buying this mobile for photography. DONT BUY PLEASE. under natural light photos look good but under unnatural lights it looks really bad. Now some might say camera is superb but i guess this is the only phone they have ever used with a camera of this category of smartphones. Trust me the nokia 7.1 though old its camera is much much better. Also the macro lens is pathetic and the selfie too. Megapixels don't make photos good. The image processing software does so Xiaomi is still way far behind.2. Wifi speed does not exceed 1.2Mbps for some reason. And i did a quick Google search many people have same issue.3. Phone feels a little too big though it is really nice for watching videos and reading.4. I have used better display than this note 8 pro in its category. My issue is with the pixels when your typing your phone you can see the small diodes. Though i believe it's because i have used better phones and it's a distraction only for me and that i am Focusing too much on it.ConclusionIf your a person like me who wants to play games and use whatsapp insta and such and click pictures on the go and don't care much about it, big battery, good display, performance like a beast go for this phone instead of a flagship phone and rather save the money and buy an ipad mini in the future.",Puti imsong, 5 February 2020
71,It's awesome!,4,"I have been using this mobile for almost 25 days now and this is my review.Display: It's actually pretty great and I don't have that much of a problem with it but if they would have given an amoled display I think it would have worked wonders. Still it's really good if you like streaming Netflix, amazon prime etc.Overall built: I think the built is good. The phone is on the heavier side and you will feel it when you start using it but once you get adjusted to a heavy phone,it won't bother you much. If you have small hands,I think reaching the fingerprint display would be an issue but if you have medium or large hands,it works fine. Personally it worked very well for me and the scanner is very fast too.Battery: The battery lasts me one full day on heavy use and that's honestly awesome so no complains there too. It takes 2hrs and 10 mins for a full charge and almost 1hr 45 mins to go from 30%-100% with its original 18watt charger. No issues here too.Camera: It's great. The image optimization is really good. Night mode is an issue tho but both rear camera and front camera give really good detailing and it's a win win situation here.Processor: as it has a Media Tek Helio G90T processor,gaming is great here. No frame drops or lags noticed. Pubg runs smoothly and on high settings. Though asphalt takes a little time to load,it's still great. It also helps in the smooth multitasking. Processor is a beast.Heating issue: there is heating issue,yes. But the liquid technology works wonders and it gets to normal temperature in less than 5 mins. Some people are complaining of the phone heating unnecessarily,I personally didn't face that problem at all.Overall it's a very very good buy. It's durable and if used properly will last you 3 years for sure. For gamers,in this price range,this is the best mobile you can buy.There are not many cons in this mobile, though some things can be improved,but still I think it's a beast and better than other mobiles launched with this at this price range.",Rewa Pathak, 14 July 2020
72,Probably the best mid range smartphone money can buy,5,"The device is definitely worth the price tag and then some, surely one of the best mid range smartphones available on the market. The device is full of perks and features - the storage read and write speed is worth considering, and with options of up-to 8GB Ram available, the device definitely competed with flagship models. Security updates and UI updates are still rolling out(may it be minimal) but to know that the device's security services are still up-to date with modern devices. I had been using the smartphone for quite a while(almost 2 years) and never did I feel the performance drop or the battery deteriorate. It does not have the top in class battery recharge speed but it is not that far behind when it comes to recharge speed. The build quality of the phone is astonishing given it is a mid range device, the only let down or I'd rather say a drawback to this impressive package is probably the display quality and the low nits ratio of the screen. But it does make up for it in the camera section as it was one of the first devices to host a 64 MP super camera with pretty decent picture output, also a very sophisticated yet balanced Pro Mode integrated in the UI. I would definitely call this a good purchase if you are in the market for an entry level flagship smartphone for the price range.",Rahul Reddy, 8 December 2021
73,Ok but too costly,4,Too costly,Jeyakumar, 9 May 2022
74,You can go for it you are a average user,4,"I got this phone next day of my order, thanks to Amazon for fast delivery, I was about the buy redmi note 9pro but I was not able to it was out of stock so I bought this one as I wanted a phone in a urgent basis, this is my first phone from MI. I have been using this phone for last 15 days now, so I am writing my opinion about this phone so that it would be helpful for other buyers. Sorry for any grammatical mistakes.Camera - Little disappointed with it, though it's 64MP but it doesn't clicks picture like 64MP, Day Pictures are fine but in night picture becomes hazzy. Portrait mode is fine, it clicks good pictures. I haven't checked other modes yet.Battery - I am not a heavy user and I don't play games a lot, so it's gives me around 1.5day battery backup, if I use continuously like watching YouTube, offiline videos, playing 1-2 hr games, then it's gives around 1 day battery backup, And it approximately takes 2.5 hrs to charge from 0-100% and yes I keep the brightness level around 30% which is enough for me for normal use.Processor - I can play games without any lags, I haven't played pubg yet, I am talking about racing games like GT racing and Real racing, but while unlocking the phone it takes around 1-2 seconds for menu to get displayed, I faced this issue after installing few apps but still I have 115 GB internal storage is left.While watching offline videos or YouTube, video it gets minimise automatically I don't know may be software issue, I have updated to the latest MIUI11, hope MI fixes it soon.Finger Print sensor works fine, haven't used face unlock yet and their are lot of other features which I haven't explored yet,So overall from my view if you are a average user (Not a heavy gamer) and you are looking for phone with all types features under 17k then you can go for this, It won't disappoint you.",Ayush, 13 August 2020

Most awaited gaming  budget smartphone in 2019⚫ Display: 3.5/5 6.53 HDR Inch Display but it could be FHD as most of the new launches are loaded with FHD in the above price segment.

76,Great performance.,5,"I am still using this phone. I installed 285 apps , there is no hang or any other problem . Great product by xiaomi",sharif ahmad, 26 June 2022
77,A versatile phone in the given range,5,"So here is my review on various features after using this phone for about 2 months:Battery life: it has a solid battery of 4500mAh, which you can use for full 2 days with normal usage.Camera : An extremely superb camera; works well in all modes be it portrait mode, night mode, 64 mp mode, slow-motion video or selfie modeRAM and processor : I played a few games on it(in high resolution) and never felt any sort of lagging,slowness thanks to the brilliant processor and huge RAM. Also has a game turbo mode that allows you to perform additional functions while playing the game.Fast charging by Type C charger : I generally keep my mobile between 20-80 % . hence it takes roughly 45 - 50 mins to charge within this range.64 GB storage : This humongous amount of storage allows installing any apps, videos, images without constantly working on removing unnecessary data. However the images taken through this camera being high quality generally take about 7-12 mb of storage and i think i may need a microsd in the future when videos and images start piling up.Design : I have a Halo White version; looks superb! Both at the back and front gives a brilliant lookVideo Quality : There is an unnecessary sharpness for videos in medium/low quality; making the image look very unnatural. If previously you have been a SAMOLED user, like me , the video quality may disappoint you a bit. However when the resolution is high ie 720p+, the video quality on the whole phone gets too great!Extension of the Camera at the back - This is one of the most irritating point in this phone; The camera's along with the fingerprint sensor rise a bit above the back's surface, even after i applied the cover, because of this you cant keep the phone anywhere you want. Mostly i keep the phone over a small cloth.MIUI : Superb!Heating : Does get a bit heated up when charging or playing game for a very long timeHotspot feature : There is no limit or monitoring on the devices that can be connected to this phone. So, upon setting a password, it automatically connects-disconnects-connects-disconnects on any random device in near range, which can be quite frustrating.Ads : Though i already had blocked the Ads option initially , when i started using the phone; but still i receive some ads from some of the inbuilt apps.Network issues : No issues faced till nowHence overall its a good phone to buy with minor set backs;  a really good option if need your phone to be good in the  gaming department.",Vibhor, 5 January 2020
78,The BEST PERFORMER Under ₹15K !! 😎,5,"Hey guys, It's Abhishek!I'm going to review the Redmi Note 8 Pro today. I've used this as my primary device for almost two weeks now.I ordered this for ₹14499 and it's a great package under ₹15K!Though Amazon delivered the product after 5-6 days of placing the order, I'm fine with it as I feel myself lucky to get it in the first ever sale!Okay, now here's the review:*BODY & DESIGN*Redmi has used glass on the back and front and polycarbonate frame on the side. It feels premium and has Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection on the front and even on the back.I ordered the Halo White variant and seriously it looks classy and elegant! No compromises on the built quality!*PERFORMANCE*It's the first smartphone, powered by MediaTek Helio G90T processor. It's a processor for gaming. Performance is TOP-NOTCH and can compete with some high range Qualcomm's processor. I played PUBG with high graphics and faced no lags/issues at all. It's the best performance smartphone under ₹15K available in the market today!*BATTERY*It's packed with a 4500mAh battery and it comes with a 18W fast charger. Battery life is excellent and easily can last for a full working day with heavy usage. You'll get 1.5 to 2 days of battery life with moderate/lite usage.It charges from 10% to 100% in 1 hour and 45 minutes.*CAMERA*It has four cameras on the back (64MP main camera+portrait lens+ultrawide lens+macro lens) and 20MP camera on the front.Camera performs really well and night photography is also excellent. Front camera performance is not upto the mark. Front camera needs OTA fixes. Xiaomi has provided better front facing cameras in the Redmi Note series in past.*SOFTWARE*It comes with Android Pie and MIUI 10 which will be updated to MIUI 11 & Android 10 later.Experience was good and it was snappy. MIUI has lots of customizations. Overall it's good!*OTHERS*It has 2+1 SIM Card slot. It has type-C port, headphone jack and IR Blaster! These are some extra plus points of this phone..Speakers are very loud, Call quality was excellent, Network reception is also strong.Now let's do the PROS & CONS for this handset:*PROS*- Performance is Excellent- Battery life is amazing- Built Quality and Design is great- Rear Camera is superb- Display is good- Speakers are very loud*CONS*- Front Camera is not so impressiveThat's all for today. Hope it will be helpful to you. Don't forget to follow me here for more reviews and please give a helpful vote if you liked my review. Thank you!",Abhishek Chattopadhyay, 6 November 2019
79,Great value for money..couldn't ask for anything else. Go for it.,4,"At the given price, we couldn't ask for anything more than what this phone offers, but there are a few flaws which needs to be highlighted too.1. The vibration alert is literally very less, and I often miss several calls. It's difficult to realise while walking on a quiet road, and impossible while riding a bike. The speakers are also just okay, and again, feels inadequate to hear the ringtones while in a noisy environment. So be prepared for it if you spend a lot of your time while out there in the traffic.2. The camera specs looks great on the paper, but are totally overrated. Forget about zooming into your 64MP photographs and getting the flawless details which the company was boasting of. During normal usage, the camera produces good photographs, while the 2x zoom is useless. Also, the ultra-wide shot loses several details, so there wouldn't be any point in clicking a noisy photograph. Low light performance is just okay with loss of details, but not satisfactory. Rest assured, if you're in properly lit environment and the subject is right in front of you, the camera is surely going to produce some very good photographs.3. The battery life is okay for max 1.5 days of normal usage.4. The LED indicator on the top is quite dim and wouldn't get your attention unless you look for it.5. The screen doesn't light up properly if you're out during the day and take out your phone to attend a call. You'll need to turn OFF the screen, and then again turn it ON by pressing the power button to see who's calling you.6. The proximity sensor doesn't work properly after you're done with the phone call and want to disconnect the call. The screen wouldn't turn ON when you remove the phone from your ear. Again, you would've to press tbe power button twice to turn the screen ON again.It surely is a phone with a great value for money, but Xiaomi shouldn't promote it like it's THE BEST one in the world, especially that 64MP camera. The quad camera setup needs better software integration for better performance I guess..",Rajat Sharma, 28 January 2020

82,Happy!,4,Using this from past two years. Quite happy with the product,Archana, 9 April 2022
83,Value for money. User interface is dull but usability is good. Feature loaded,4,"I am writing this review after using the device (Redmi note 8 pro) for about 15 days. I must say I am pretty surprised to see the capabilities of this device in this price range. First I must mention that 6GB ram n 128GB memory(ROM) in 16k was a steal deal for me. The battery lasts for about a day with more than moderate to quite heavy usage. If I use it with respect battery lasts for about a day n half easy with about 15% juice left. With better t saver it will easily stretch to 2 days with less than moderate usage. Finger print reader is almost accurate for about 4 out of 5 times, it also depends on how perfectly we do the initial scan of finger. Feel is very smooth and display is crisp n very detailed with a premium feel to the touch and response. My only disappointment so far is with the user interface. It does not have any app list like in other OS. MIUI just let's all apps on home screen making it a clutter. So I have to arrange it as per usage.A very important thing to mention here is that though I received a fast charger in the box but it does not do quick charge. I thought it does not show fast charging but it took about 3 n half to 4 hrs to chanrge using the stock charger. Then one fine day I used my powerbank which had fast charging and found it was doing a quick charge and did charge full in 2 hrs. Then I tried it with another charge which I knew was a fast charger and it also charged quick with proper notification on device. So here I don't know how I got a duplicate or defective charger in a sealed box. But I am disappointed with the charger to a great extent. Though I can buy a new one or just use charger of another device but this is the main reason I am deducting 1 star. Thanks for reading. Hope it helps make ur mind.",MYK, 28 February 2020

87,Good phone to buy,4,"My first impression was like wow it is a beast and definitely a massive upgrade from MI A1 and it holds true even after 1 month of usage. Now lets talk about this phone and what I experienced on daily usage.Pros:1. Well the camera in good light condition is super awesome have some nice clicks.  Color capture in very good . The night mode(in decent light only) is definitely better than most of the phones in the sense that the background light capture is awesome. While the other phones were spreading the light all over it captures perfect light. (The picture quality however is passable only), noise cancellation of light is better.2. Game players would love this phone as it delivers the power it require to play lag free.3. The wifi connectivity is good getting very good pings while playing PUBG4. Finger print scanner is super fast and face detection happens successfully in low light condition as well.5. 2-sim + memory slot is definitely a good addition in this phone.Cons:1. Camera fails to perform good in low light condition. Even at good light macro mode is not that crisp even though colors are good.2. Heating problem is there and I am not sure it will go away as the display is LCD and it will heat up the phone. However the heat is not that uncomfortable.3. Battery of 4500 doesn't do justice to the phone it does last for a day of normal usage but for gaming may be max of 4-6 hours depending on setting and the game you play.4. Some bloatware from MI is too much, can stop then in app setting but cannot completely uninstall it..In all for a phone this price I would say it is good. If you are looking for camera and know how to play with settings then go for it, for gaming experience also this phone is good. My game improved a lot in this phone compared to before as no framing or lag because of wifi connectivity.",Robindra Jain, 12 November 2019

97,Was definitely worth it in October 2019,4,"I'm writing this review after using this phone for a year. I bought 8/128 model.  At the time based on specifications, it was the best in it's category. After using it for a year, I assure you I haven't faced a single problem for the first 11 months. Recently, the issue I am facing is of the phone heating up slightly, and taking a bit longer to charge. Despite changing the cable and outlet the problem persists. However, other than this, for the first year it has run flawlessly. Camera quality is of course not as good as OnePlus or iPhone despite the high megapixel, but it will definitely satisfy your day to day needs. The speed and performance have never let me down, no app or game lags or hangs on this phone. Battery life is amazing, as is the battery saver mode. I would say that the speaker volume is slightly on the lower side, and unfortunately there is no way to improve that. However I would guess that most people would use earphones in any case, and the alarm volume is completely fine. Usually the lock button starts to give me a problem in my phone's but that is not the case here. Front camera is also decent. All in all, in October 2019 I felt I made a great decision, maybe today there are better products available for the price, but in case there is a discount on this model, I'd still reccomend it. The camera juts out, so make sure you get a sturdy case so you can comfortably keep the phone face up or face down on any surface. Another budget gem from Xiaomi.",K.M, 29 October 2020

99,Best budget phone,4,"Writing this after using for 5 months,Every thing is good.. but I am giving 4 out of 5 because when I got this phone it was not supporting HD streaming over OTT especially for Netflix because after buying this I started using Netflix 😜 and think how it feels that your new phone doesn't support HD streaming 😵Finger print working is good and the way that they placed finger print and is actually nice but I gave 4 out of 5 because it is designed like slightly embossed type,... Whenever I place my mobile on table I put it up side down... Because it makes me feel that camera gets scratches.😣😣Actually I would have given camera 5 out of 5 for camera because my friend is using OnePlus, but it's my Redmi note 8 pro camera is better than his OnePlus camera, but night mode sucks,,... When I take photos in night mode it feels like some special effects added, not much natural colour so I rated 4 out of 5It comes with built in Alexa, but I turned it off because it gave me so much trouble when I turned it on..Here is how it gave me trouble1, we are in tea break at that time I called my friend loudly as mahesha, mahesha, he doesn't looked at me but Alexa opened in my phone🙆2, we were in meating when our maneger was saying we have to spend some 'extra' time(he was pointing word extra) Alexa was opened😭3, I was watching Our planet series in Netflix, when David attenberg saying 'fishes' Alexa opened😣So after all these problems I turned off Alexa and now I am using Google assistant",Shivaprasad d., 4 July 2020

Ps: their is a notification Led 🔔on the front cam 📸 best thing to getFORM FACTOR- 📚The phone is on a heavier side due to its battery(but REDMI NOTE series 💪📱😂 are always heavy) and should be handled with both hands, the glass back phones should be cared well for its fragile nature.

You should absolutely go for this beast and beauty. Redmi is doing justice to its consumer with such competitive phones.. This phone easily competes with the price range of 20K phones.

113,An All-Rounder,4,"I have been using this phone for around 2 months now and I'm quite happy with the performance of the phone.The fingerprint scanner is exceptionally fast and has an astute haptic feedback. I was particularly happy with the camera quality. Although the 64MP option is not really useful (as it just eats up all of the disc space), it is really cool to have that feature and the photos taken in the 64MP feature turned on is sharp and crisp and encorporate a lot more details.The Helio G90T processor is really fast and responsive and works pretty well for gaming and for ordinary day-to-day tasks as well, although it being a 13nm process doesn't really help with the battery life. It lasted me hardly a day and I can't quite complain, considering the fact that I use the phone a lot and do a lot of heavy gaming like PUBG Mobile (the game runs on high graphic settings by default) but if you are a normal user who uses the phone for day-to-day tasks, it would probably last you a day and a half or more. The 18W fast charger provided with the phone charges it pretty quickly considering the 4500 mah battery of the Redmi Note 8 Pro.Although it has an IPS LCD screen, it's one of the best screens so far with as deep blacks as an AMOLED screen.All in all, it's an all-rounder of a phone and if you are looking for one that is in the sub-15000 Rs range, then this is definitely a phone that you should check out.",Sajan Daniel, 9 March 2020

118,Built for gamers. .Review after 3 weeks..,4,"Well i am using this phone for a couple of weeks and i found that battery is draining faster, hope will be fixed with an update. For playing PUBG this phone is remarkable not facing any lags, well i play with smooth/Extreme graphics settings. This is built for gamers and we cant find a phone under 20k price range for best gaming, G90T is built for gaming. No issues in day to day usage as i installed a lot of Apps and still running smoothly. I went for a 6/64 variant as i have a memory card of 128 gb. Thanks to that extra slot. Display is quite good in this price range comparing with realme 6, good brightness level and HDR10 supported. Build quality is premium, nice and handly, looks premium, just dissappointed with fingerprint sensor built parallel to camera. Ram management is quite good. Go for it guys if you are an insane gamer and looking a phone under 20k price range. Little bit heating 🔥 issue is there but not crossed 41 in room temperature while playing PUBG in extreme graphics which i prefer, but we wont find any lag.charging time is about 2 hours from 15 to 100 percent.and 100 to 30 percent for 5 to 6 games of pubg thats approx 2 hrs or more. .speaker quality is normal. Give likes if u find this usefull. Cheers 🥂 👍",Nandu, 17 June 2020

120,wondeful phone for all everybody,4,I am using this phone for last one month .Let me put my observations ( 128 GB 8GB RAM version)1. Great camera -- The more i am using more i am learning. I have SLR but these photos are really good.2. Attending per day 6 hrs of  online classes with video recording .  Never failed . Also i am using multi tasking mode.3. The response is awesome. I can perform online video processing when doing other work. Brilliant.4. The battery is a little disappointing. I had to do a quick charge twice.5. It has to overheat protection. Whenever my mobile gets overheated then redmi switches some of the unnecessary options6.  Ia have tons of pplication related to educatioonal music and video processing also many testing toll. Actually i replaced my damanged laptop with this phone . I cannot thak redmi enough for the powerful processing with zero lag . One advice. There is one PUBG turbo mode. If you enable that during your video processing it boosts up performance significantly.I got stuck in lockdown in a remote place. But this mobile saved me from all the hassles. from remote access to multiple class and video processing its a powerhouseI would have given 5 star but BATTERY! !!!!Recommended highly this phone,mainak ghoshhajra, 23 June 2020

123,GREAT,4,"¹°CAMERA was the main focus of the particular smartphone. It hosts a 64 MP MAIN CAMERA with 3 other rear cameras and a 20 MP front shooter. It does a phenomenal job while clicking photos  (I have added some sample shots. You will notice that I removed the watermark option in some of the photos). Although the Night Mode sucks , one of the worst that's why I reduced 1 star. But in daylight it does a fabulous job²°DISPLAY was an issue . I believe that if it was an LED screen it would have been  so much better. But the LCD panel does a fairly good job.Thanks to the large display.³°PROCESSOR should be no problem for you people . I don't play games so I don't know about it's gaming capabilities. Everyday task works smoothly .👍⁴°BATTERY is fairly large and it lasts a day for me . Again I would say that I don't play games so I don't know about the battery capabilities under heavy usages. The 18 W charger does a good job but I wish it was a 27 W or the new 33 W charger.⁵° OTHER HIGHLIGHTS---  The in hand feel is really great , I don't use the case so it's not that heavy . But if u use a case it is really heavy to use while laying down and when using single handedly. Speaker is not that loud.YEAH THAT'S ALL.HOPE I WAS ABLE TO HELP YOU.",Joy, 3 January 2020

(Supports HDR content which looks awesome)*amazing set of cameras.*camera to api out of the box*gaming mediatek processor is a blaze. Was a snapdragon fanboy till this device arrived.*USB type c for charging and data transfer.*18w fast charging. which is definitely a speedy charge for those who haven't experienced it before.*Fingerprint reader is blazing fast, so is face unlock.CONS:*low light camera performance not that great (Here, camera to api helps)*18w fast charging though is good, they could have provided a faster charger.*speakers don't have punch*face unlock is not as secure as a 3d scanning present in other devices, but its acceptable.*updates seems to be late.My view towards this product is that it is a bang for your buck. Handles games like butter and has no heating issues till now. Every phone heats up so does this but not anything alarming. 3 hours of pubg in hdr ultra is a breeze. The cameras are awesome and provides a huge variety of lenses for your every needs. Screen is awesome with gorilla glass 5 protection on front and back, havent used a tempered glass yet and has no scratches till now.Awesome product, I recommend this product to all.",Sayan Patel, 23 May 2020
126,Review after 2 years,5,this phone is really good to use. After two years also working completely fine no major problems did not come at the time of the update there may be little bit glitches but after the security patch update it working fine but nowadays you can buy a better phone at this rate,praveen kumar, 15 March 2022
127,Good budget phone with ok camera and poor speakers,4,"Great budget phone however has its own pros and cons. The processor is good and the phone feels smooth in everyday use. The daily tasks are a done in a breeze. Games run smooth and the performance is up to par. Battery life is good enough and phone also comes with a fast charger.Additional plus for this phone include a notification light, a headphone jack, amazing looks especially the Gamma green looks fantastic. One more plus is the dedicated SD card slot.On the bad side of things, the main selling point the camera, could have really been way better. You need steady hands for most of the shots and the pictures aren't really that sharp. Most of them are grainy if you zoom in and the video performance is poor. For a camera concentrated phone, this is unacceptable.Additionally, the sound output is really really weak. Headphone out is really good but the phone speaker is really not that loud enough and it's hard to hear at even at the max volume. Call audio is also sometimes poor and the speaker is not positioned well for answering calls via phone. Also missing is the amoled technology for the screen that gives away the otherwise great display unit. The blacks are not that great when you are in dark and you can see the difference clearly. For the price while this is still a great pick, the camera could have been really better even if they had to compromise on something else for the price.",Arvind R, 6 December 2019

129,Recommended Smartphone under ₹16000 Even in Aug 2020,5,"This phone is all rounder in terms of Everything.If you are thinking to buy a phone at ₹16k, I would recommend this phone.I bought my Redmi note 8 pro around mid July and was delivered within 4 days.Here are Some Pros of this Phone you should know if you are going to buy it in 2020:✅ Display is buttery smooth and looks good for a mid range smartphone.✅ This phone has a gaming processor, So It is made for performance.✅ Go for 128gb variant, you will get a lag free experience.✅ This phone has a back panel of Flagship phones which looks absolutely stunning in comparison to other phones. Also I like phones with center camera setup. It's my personal opinion many of you may feel the same.✅ After updating to the latest Android 10 miui version, My experience has been super good.✅ I don't use the camera very often but I takes some really good looking shots. Also Slo-mo videos are pretty awesome.✅ After 7-8 hrs of medium usage with wifi connected almost everytime, It lasted a whole day.✅ Also it supports quick charge, so 60 mins charge gives me 90% battery.Here are some cons about this phone:▶️ It has some heating issue, gets pretty warm in after a reboot and heavy gaming sessions.▶️ If you are okay with the dot notch, then it looks amazing.If you looking for a decent smartphone in the ₹15k-18k range, which has these specs:Performance: 4.5/5Display: 4/5Gaming: 4.5/5Camera: 4/5Battery:4/5Then you should definitely think about this one.",G, 17 August 2020
130,It is amazing,5,Nothing... It is seriously amazing,PritiDisha Kanungo, 20 May 2022
131,Perfect Package in A Budget,5,"For a 4050 mAh battery, this phone works throughout the day and could continue for more than 24 hours. I am a heavy user and stay out of the house for longer hours, so I need a heavy battery phone and this works great for me. The camera (both front and back) is really amazing and I'd say it is better than an iPhone. It's really smooth, especially when I played PUBG initially, I was like, ""Wow! This is super smooth."" I love gaming and sometimes I play for hours. And this was up to the mark although it got heated up a bit around the camera, but that's where the processor is I guess, so it's justified. That's not a big issue though because it cools down fast as well. The storage is really nice, it works perfect. There were some apps I didn't need like Opera Mini, so I uninstalled it. I love androids because they come in with great themes, and MI themes are wonderful. I like playing with the themes and fonts and all, and this is really nice. I love the MIUI 11 update. Plus in this phone, you can use it in a full screen mode that allows you to remove the footer which has the home button, back button and the recents tray. That is similar to the iOS themes. It gets charged really quick. The original charger that comes with the phone in the box is great. Obviously, there is no earplugs or earphones with the phone. Instead, you get a nice soft cover with this. I ordered a ""Shadow Black"" phone and it came in with a translucent black back cover. I don't know if they provide same colour covers or transparent ones with the others.",Amazon Customer, 12 June 2020
132,My experience with Note 8 Pro,4,"Being using for a week. Below is my experience with the phone.Pros*Design*Processor. G90T is great. No much heating as rumoured.*Ram and storage for the price*Display. Though not Amuled but they have tweaked it well with HDR. So no fuzz about display quality.*Fingerprint and face unlock.Both are very quick.*Camera, though not a great user of Camera but when i compared with my old Oneplus 5t it is crisp and details are good. You get quad cam with 64M sensor from Samsung. Bit of tweak has to be done to make it more better through software update.But overall better than others in that price segment.Cons: This is not exactly an issue but i would like to give a heads-up* Miui OS, this runs on top of Android. But if you are looking for stock like feel. You will be disappointed. You can do workaround like i installed Poco launcher which replicated similar to stock feel. You have to also get rid of Ads.*Weight of the phone. I felt lill bulky with 200gms.*L1 certification. Cannot watch Netflix or Prime with HD. You have to be satisfied with standard definition. Xaiomi claims to fix this in Q(10) update.Finally it all boils down to price. If any other phone beats this with better features go for it. But for now i guess this is the better option available.  What you pay is what you get....",Kiran K., 25 January 2020

136,MY REVIEW FOR THE REDMI NOTE 8 PRO,5,"I've been using this device since 8 days (6GB+128GB Green), and I've got the actual performance of this phone. So, this is my complete review of the phone:PERFORMANCE: I installed PUBG Mobile in it, and by default, it was set to high graphics, as recommended. I ran the game in HDR + Ultra, and the game ran as smooth as butter. On Antutu, this phone scored 284973, which is actually the score of iPhone X. I was literally shocked, when I saw this score.CAMERA: The groundbreaking 64MP camera did an unbelievably good work. It can shoot videos upto 1080p 60fps and 4K 30 fps, and slow motion videos at 720p 960fps. The 20MP selfie camera did its job pretty well, taking some natural pictures in both indoor and outdoor conditions.LOOKS: The phone looks as beautiful as hell! The glass back just magnifies its beauty to an another level. The Phone is also protected by Gorilla Glass 5, on both the front and the back.BATTERY: The phone gives the battery life of flagships. While fully charged, you can watch YouTube for 10 hours at 10% brightness. Also, the 18W fast charger provided in the box charges it from 0-90 within 1 hour 30 mins, regardless of having a 4500 mAh battery.OTHER FEATURES: The MIUI 10 with Android 9.0 Pie provided out-of-the-box is well optimised for this device. It comes with a system-wide dark mode, that increase its battery life, by reducing battery usage. The speakers are actually very loud. The P2i coating protects the phone against water splashes. It also has a dedicated microSD Card slot. The IR blaster present in it makes it extremely good. Also, Xiaomi has also announced that they would be providing Android 10 (MIUI 11) by December 25 via OTA.Encompassing all this features, Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro is the best Mid-Ranger in this price segment. I would recommend you to checkout this phone before buying any other device under 15-18K",Arkaprabho Choudhury, 28 November 2019

138,I FINALLY GOT MY BABY!!,5,"I know, it's dramatic but I LOVE gadgets, I was saving for it for SO LONG!! I worked in low salary job with the only aim to buy this guy one day!! I was confused between Realme and this one but let me tell you what I found during my endless research, ""Redmi Offers you what Realme is offering in less price.""Maybe it's because the launch delay and the competition between the two. I had Redmi Note 3 before this and it's perfectly fine except of battery drain out and lack of storage. I was thinking of trying Realme but nope! Same thing in less price who doesn't want that?My focus while looking for a phone was a better camera and TONS of storage.SO,Things That I Liked:)It has amazing camera!Dedicated SD card slot with dual sim!THE COLOUR!!! aka Gama Green!The processor and all that stuff that I don't understand but experts say is great!Things that I don't like:(The cameras and fingerprinting sensors are bulking OUT! that makes my ocd brain worry  A LOT for the lens! the camera is important because ai love nature's photography.Tooooo many in built mi related apps that are just waste of storage and are not that useful! I would use mi store if it had everything that a Playstore has but it doesn't, so it's useless.These things are livable but I hope they consider improving it to make the best!Thanks Redmi for making affordable phones.EDIT AFTER 10 MONTHS! The hotspot does not have a block option. I STILL LOVE IT! THE BEST IS CAMERA QUALITY!",Lostinmind.zz, 11 June 2020

143,Not a bad phone at this price point.,3,"It's a good mobile at Rs. 13999. After using this phone for 40 days, I am writing this review. Just think twice before buying this phone. There are better processors at this price and numerous options are available in the market now.Pros:First of all the build quality of redmi note 8 pro is awesome. It's glass body is wonderful. I just loved it.Finger print reader is blazing fast.Face unlock also working well.Touch sensitive is also very good.Ram management is good.4500 mah Battery comes for a day for an average user.Gaming is also good.Display is adequate. Being an IPS LCD display it's fine.Cons:No widevine l1 certification, which means we cannot watch Amazon prime video and Netflix at full hd resolution.It takes 2hours for full charge(0 to 100%) and Phone gets heating slightly while charging.Camera sensor is not upto the mark. A 13mp camera of other phone is giving clear images than 64mp camera of redmi note 8 pro. Maybe be the issues would be resolved in future updates.I am irritated with hotspot of redmi note 8 pro. The hotspot connecting to other phones but not connecting to PC (the PC condition is good and other phones are connecting). Its horrible if we get a half working hotspot with a phone of Rs. 13999.It also lacking WPS entry option for wifi.Speaker out put incase of audio and video is good. But incase of ringtone for incoming call, we have to keep full volume other wise we cannot hear the ring tone.There are number of bugs in this phone and they might be resolved after updates. Till then we have to wait.Except the cons above, everything is fine with redmi note 8 pro.",Harish, 4 March 2020

145,Very good...,5,Still I'm using it,NOOR MOHAMAD, 12 May 2022
146,The BEST phone ever!!!,5,"Redmi Note 8 Pro is just amazing and undisputed device in midrange.I'm writing review after using it for 6 months.Camera : Perfect camera 10/10 even if it is NOT using sony sensor, PRO mode in Night is also great.Display : 10/10 FHD+ IPS & HDR10 support makes the display unique at this price range. (would have been more happy if it is Amoled)Speaker : 9/10 Its already Loud and crisp clear but little bit more loudness would have been great.Build Quality : Gorilla glass 5 on both back & front so no worries, but still its a glass back so you need a good armour cover like SPIGEN to protect the Camera bump as well as frequent drops.Storage : UFS 2.1 is fast enough to transfer your data from mobile to pc and also faster data processing.Mic : Its clear and also cancel outs the noise and distortion. i.e. it has a secondary mic!!Battery : Initially on miui 10 it was great but now its giving somewhat less output but Still no need to worry as it lasts easily for the even playing some heavy games for 2-3 hrs.If you are a normal user it will last about 2 days depending on ur usage.Processor : Mediatek G90T is just powerful as SD730G even better i can say no lags at all.And this is it!!!Its still the best buy in midrange segment!!!",Saurabh, 20 October 2020
147,Great but not the best,4,"Writing the review after using it for 2 months. I am not a photo-man so cannot comment on camera like a professionalPROS1. Very elegant and premium design2. Nice colours3. Never faced lag even a single time inspite of playing basic games and using multiple apps at a time4. Very fast charging5. Using 256 gb HP micro sd card. No issues. Handles very well6. Awesome camera specially macro lens feature7. Xiaomi has given a very beautiful cover with this phone, although it hides the back look of the phoneCONS1. Battery back up not among the best but not bad either. My previous phone was MI MAX 2 and it stands nowhere near it in terms of battery. Would last 1 day on heavy usage2. Slow Wifi Speed. Have compared with at least 3 phones and a laptop with the same broadband connection. (I have deducted 1 star specially for this problem)3. Wifi and Bluetooth dont work well together.4. I somehow felt the clarity of videos (downloaded HD movies) was not good as compared to my MI MAX 2 (almost same screen size)My final verdict is that it's a great phone but don't expect it to be a perfect phone",Sandeep, 3 February 2020

149,Must Read Before You Buy....,5,"Okay guys this is the review that you would want to read before you buy this phone...Bought this as a new year present to self n now after two days of usage this is what I've to say....Pros1. Battery life. Guys the battery is huge n after one charge previous morning n one full day of heavy usage it's still showing 36% of juice left in it.2. Fingerprint Reader. It's as good as they come...no problem whatsoever...works like a dream...3. Design. Staple MI design, the quad cam setup with finger print reader is perfectly positioned...it's not premium but hey I'm not complaining...4. Processor n RAM. I'm using the 6+128GB variant, RAM optimisation is brilliant, G90 with Octa Core@ 2.05GHz is doing the job wonderfully well...5. Alexa. For all those Alexa fans, it's a welcome feature at no extra cost...6. MIUI. comes with MIUI Global 10.4.4...which is smooth n user friendly nd I'm sure the latest patch will be available soon...7. Budget. @16000/ this is reasonably priced considering the competition in the segment.Cons1. Weight. This is a huge phone...n hence it's bulky n after some time Ur hand starts to pain...2. Camera quality. I was a bit disappointed with the camera quality considering it's a quad cam setup with 64 MP as primary..but hey it's okay at this price3. Single hand operation. Found it a lil difficult owing to its size.4. Overall feel. Not very premium, polycarbonate back, looks n feel very cheap.Overall...I would say it's a good budget buy with all those features....Don't go looking for something extraordinary...then u will enjoy it...Lastly a word about Amazon delivery...Ordered at 1800h in evening n received at 0800h in the morning through free delivery option, mind boggling...Thanks for reading...found it useful...leave a like...",NeeKap, 9 January 2020
150,Mi phone high on specs but lacking basic feature of android auto with dual app functionality,4,"A honest review after 1 weeks use. I am not promoting any brand it's my personal opinion.The ProsMi phone good on specs . Pretty good battery back up so far (1week use). Camera quality is good but not the best . Value for money , same specs cost more in other brands. IR blaster not present in most phones infact none. Screen protection. Good build quality , gives a premium look in white. Display is crisp for an IPS.Now the consMoving from samsung to MI was pretty difficult as ui not the best personally samsung was better . Data transfer not possible from Sam to mi. Worst of all android auto will not work with dual app, so if u r a frequent traveller and use android auto function then DONT EVEN THINK OF MI phones. Regret my purchase now. Phone seems to heat up slightly on continuous use can be felt beyond the flexi cover .Overall it's a good phone for normal phone users would never recommend the phone over samsung ui's simplicity.Update: Adding 1 more 🌟  , my issue of using android auto was resolved by using the 2nd space option. MI to release update quickly to help fellow customers get the complete benefit of using dual apps with android auto.",Babu R, 26 January 2020

152,Not for Gaming.,5,If u r looking this for gaming like freefire and pubg then hold on its not good for gaming. It lags so much and also fps drops to zero evey second makes gameplay very annoying. My 5 gb ram is free and 117 gb storage is free. Yet I face so much lags and fps drops. At last I just want to say if u need this phone for other things then u should definitely buy this but in case u also wants better gaming then this is not for u. Helio processor is not for gaming. Buy other phones with Snapdragon processor. Only snapdragen processor is best for gaming.,Rittik, 20 September 2021

154,Best in class at this Price Segment..,5,"1) MIUI 10 doesn't seem to be as riddled with bloatware and apps as was the case with her Redmi Note 4 (which was an ad minefield). Most of the extra apps can be uninstalled.2) The presence of system ads also seems to have gone down a lot compared to her Note 4. I did a debloat and uninstalled unwanted software like Mi Music using ADB, and disabled all the recommendations in the remaining apps, disabled App Scanning (pointless) and it seems to be really clean now. Only some essential Google apps remain. This process hardly takes 10 minutes at the most. There is a java utility in XDA by Saki that really helps with the debloat! Thanks a million for this!3) The phone seems to be really snappy and quick. No heating observed while charging.4) Seems to be built really well. The phone has a nice heft to it. Power and volume buttons are quite tactile and feel good. The Gamma Green color is a looker (this is coming from someone who hates gradient colors and has a strong preference for matte black and greys)5) Screen is pretty good, actually. Colors are pleasant and blacks are as good as an LCD can manage. Contrast also seems to be good. No complaints. Chose an LCD equipped phone on purpose.6) Comes bundled with an 18W charger and a transparent case.7) There is a noticeable camera bump at the back which is super annoying to me. The included case doesn't make it flush. A tiny part is still sticking out. Ordered a Nillkin frosted shield case which has additional clearance for the hump and offers more protection.8) Relatively consumer friendly as it still has the good old 3.5 mm jack and a dedicated SD card slot.",Rishav Kumar, 29 December 2019
155,After 8 months of use this is what I found about this phone,4,"I have been using this phone for 7-8 months now here is what I foundPro1. Amazing camera quality with 64 mp and the ultra wide angle gives the flexibility of shooting different senario with great quality,though video recording isn't  good enough.2. The battery quality is decent with fast charging capability you can do pretty much everything in a day( from playing games for a reasonable amount of time to watching YouTube and everything else which we normally use our phone for) and don't need to charge it.3. We can smoothly run any app and play any game in high qualityCon.1. After some time the fingerprint reader is annoying  which I find pretty disappointing.2. Surprisingly this phone will heat up sometimes even when no app is running if the temperature of the room is high enough like on a hot day in car..  normally you will not notice it.Hope my experience will help you in choosing your best phone",junaid, 13 August 2020

157,best mobile best camera best battery.,5,"Best camera best battery.The best phone seen in my life which fulfils every requirement of a person it has the best:CameraSpeedDisplayStorageProcessorRedmi Note 8 Pro (8GB ram, 128 GB storage space) was my third Redmi mobile. Previously I had Redmi 3s prime, and Redmi 4.I am writing this review after using the phone for almost one week. I am a gaming freak. 😉Redmi Note 8 pro is one of the best mobile launched in the segment of below Rs. 20,000/-.Camera is very good, but it needs natural light to make the photo crystal clear. There are grains in the photo, even in 64 MP lens, if the photos are taken in the low light area. So you need ample amount of light to make the photo clear, I mean to make you love your photos. 😉Selfie camera is also very good, specially that bokeh mode 😍, but again the same, you need ample amount of light to make the photos crystal clear or else you will find grains in your photos.Performance is very good. Games like Pubg and Call of Duty Mobile can be played in High graphic without lag, but you should have decent internet speed. While playing games, the mobile heats up even though its has liquid cool technology. But this is a minor issue of high end gaming processor.Xiaomi offer a user friendly interface which I personally think is better than any other brand.Screen size is also big. It adds up to your entertainment.Face recognition feature needs to be a little advanced since it unlocks the device but does not remove the lock screen wallpaper.I personally like the  black model because I myself bought it 😉 and I think its the better from the green and white one.",Mahesh mhase, 13 November 2019
158,"Good phone, terrible video camera quality (low light video flickering bugs)",3,"Everything about the phone seemed perfect initially. The build quality, the smooth performance, the crisp pictures on the camera, but this didn't last long. Only a few months (6-8) and I've already noticed so many bugs with the phone, it takes great pictures but the video quality of the camera is absolutely horrendous, if the room isn't completely filled with natural light and even a little dim the video immediately starts to flicker like its having a seizure, the video footage becomes absolutely unusable when this happens. But even in broad daylight the video seems to struggle with capturing video with good dynamic range, it constantly gets dimmer and brighter at random angles and the audio isn't great either, it's muffled and soft often a little distorted. Honestly a terrible choice if you're looking to take videos and post of pretty much anything and it's most probably the G90T chipset's fault as the processor is responsible for most of the video quality. Other than for issues with the video camera it mostly works fine, a few glitches here and there and a few ads initially but after disabling them I haven't had a single issue with ads. The phone is built well and works well most of the time but I honestly wish I had waited for the note 9 pro or another phone entirely due to this horrendous camera and video capture issue as I enjoy taking videos for social media. I simply have to rate this phone a 6/10 due to the terrible video camera issues but for you gaymers out there this phone is a 9/10 an ideal budget phone for gaming.",Potta Demo, 13 July 2020

161,Redmi Proves the Power Again,5,"This phone from Redmi is a performance beast and I did not find any small lags in a regular usage but not found even a frame drop in heavy duty games like Shadowgun, PUBG, Call of Duty (all 3 with highest possible graphics).Camera is superior to the most of the flagships out there in the market including S10, OP7T. Night mode is insane and the clarity will make you click more photos. 64MP mode is detail oriented and you get plenty of details in a jpg file of 20mb.Selfie camera is awesome. Portraits are well captured and the features like studio effects makes selfies more attractive.Fingerprint unlock is insanely fast and I have never seen such speed of unlocking in any other smartphone out there as on date.Face unlock is also no short of bang on target, regardless of lighting conditions. (Be it bright day, pitch dark, extremely low light with shaking hand (being the car), side face).The good thing about face unlock is that it will work only when your eyes are open (means one can not simply unlock your device while you are sleeping)Battery is also good, day to day usage will reduce batter very gradually. Standby loss is 2% between 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. but I found the drainage bit faster while playing games. Hope to get this fixed in updates.Screen is not AMOLED but believe me, you will not regret for that. Redmi has implemented HDR Compliant screen which works extremely well with YouTube, Netflix, Prime, HotStar and many other apps that I may not know.Colors are punchy and sunlight view is more than comfortable.Design is very attractive.Overall (5/5)",Harsh Madhvi, 6 January 2020
162,A decent phone at a decent price.,4,"Redmi note 8 pro, the pictures and the videos don't do justice to how good this phone looks. After 2 days of use I  feel this phone has a great potential. In this price range this is a good phone I am an MI user I was using MI A1 bought it in 2017 December and it still works amazing, this time I wanted to go back to apple or buy some other phone but my wife suggested me this one and clearly she was not wrong. Gamers you won't be disappointed turbo mode makes your gaming seamless and the battery will take it, doesn't heat as much as some  videos say. , yea I have had some issues with 2nd space  but deleting that would be fine. If you are thinking of buying this for Camera, please don't though the camera is good but not as good as other phones have at the same price range but if you want to buy it for other purposes daily use etc this will do you complete justice.",Deepak, 11 May 2020

164,Research before you invest,5,"One of my best mobile purchases ever. I graduated from Moto G5S plus to this a month or two back. Here are 3 things which clicked for me:1. It doesn't hangWhen you have 8GB RAM to back you up, you'll never slow down. This phone never hangs. As a social media professional, I needed a mobile for quick access to social media channels and open multiple apps at a time. The earlier phones I was using hanged a lot, but not this one. It offers a very smooth functionality.2. Great picture qualityIf you want to know what 64 MP camera clicked photos look like then do check the photos I've shared. The camera quality is simply out of this world.3. Large screenThese days, we consume most of our content on mobile phones. From watching Netflix to playing games - a large screen does wonders for the user. This phone is blessed with that!Now comes the hard part - the cons.While recording a long video or going live, the phone tends to heat up. I still haven't figured out how to go about it, but I understand for some this can be a deal breaker.

167,"Was doing well till now, stopped working abruptly today!!",3,"Received and System Launcher update, after installing the update the phone hangs and just glows and dims continuously.Have mailed the customer care as well as posted on the MI community form about the issue but now solution provided yet.Using Xiaomi phones since past 4 years but never had such an issue, and as it is my first issue with the Xiaomi phones, It was the first time contacting the customer care as well as using the online forms, Sadly the experience is pathetic.Moreover the phone got the issue when I had to send an urgent mail, it was so frustrating!!I always trusted Xiaomi Phones specially Redmi series, used 3s Prime, Y2 and now Note 8 Pro.But the issue and the customer care service has shaken the Reliability of Xiaomi and the Trust I had.I do not want to lose My Data at all, It is important.Since the issue is caused by the update that I received I want you to take the responsibility for My lose.Kindly provide the solution for this asap and ask your customer support guys to at least understand what a user is telling.After telling again and again that the phone just hangs as it is powered Up still they ask me to go to settings etc etc.I don't know how to reach the settings open in a hanged phone. If anyone of You knows let Me know too.Problem:Power On->asks for pattern-> freezes for a second->then again locks->loses all the connectivity-> freezes and the screen just glows and dims.Its like it is taking it's last breaths!!Kindly Provide Me a proper solution.",Gautam, 7 February 2020
168,Love IT!,5,"Bought the 6GB/128GB Shadow Black Variant on 13/November. Got it delivered within a week. Firstly not a very good packaging via Amazon.Now for the Device, I am upgrading from a Note 6 Pro to Note 8 Pro.Great First Impressions.Have been using it to the maximum.Gaming Experience is too good. Overheating issues? Not much that would make me stop Gaming.Detailed Review.Display - Picture Perfect. Watching 4k 60fps on this Beast is mind-blowing.Screen Brightness is somewhat low compared to my previous device. 9/10Build Quality - Top Grade Build with Premium Feel.For this price range, MI has done a brilliant work.RAM - Great RAM Management. Have Used a maximum of 4.5GB at a moment running multiple Games parallely. 9/10MIUI - Buttery Smooth Interface. Ads are a bit irritating once in a while, but there are ways to completely disable MI ads via some tweaks.Have received Miui11 Update based on Android 9. Android 10 expected by mid December. 9/10Battery - Not very impressed. With an above average usage and frequent short phase gaming, I am able to get a battery backup of about 1 day max. 7/10Camera - Nothing very impressive as the ""World's First 64MP Quad Camera"" Tag suggested. MI is doing quite a lot of image processing which is clearly visible. Selfies at times give brushed finishes.Its just an above average Sensor. Software Update would make the images better. Let's wait. 7/10Gaming - This is what the phone is meant for. Supreme Gaming Experience. Near to Desktop Gaming Experience. Asphalt Legends at max settings runs butter smooth. COD does a great job as well at max settings.I got this device for 15,999 INR. DO Not OVERTHINK. This is the best deal you could ever get.",Mukesh Murugan, 22 November 2019

170,"Other than battery life, everything seems ok",4,"The only problem i am facing after 1 year of use is battery as it drains too quickly. Rest all is ok.

WiFi strength is good.5. Fingerprint is blazing fast.6. For 60FPS gaming it is good.7. Jio 4G video calling is enabled.CONS:1. Mediatek has heating problem as usual.2. Night photography is not good.3. GCam has problems as it has mediatek processor.4. PubG smooth extreme setting will create some frame drops while streaming.5. Battery drains fast while playing PubG6. Glass back is awesome in looks but there is risk of shattere.7. Video quality is really poor if you play less resolution videos. I don't know why??8. Netflix HD streaming still not got enabled.9. Security updates are not updated like other Redmi devices.10. Gaming mode has some notifications issues.11. As promised internal audio and ingame voice will be recorded like iphone is not working at all.Verdict: If you want only performance than go for Poco F1.

173,Good for gaming only,4,"I am using this mobile from 8months. So i simply review this product as pros and cons wise.firstly pros:1.GOOD processor for gaming at this price,even in 2021 till now.2. Good looking .3. Best battery backup.4. 64 mp camera is quite better(not much better ).still need improvement.5. Front camera is pretty much better.Cons:1.poor built quality.( Sides are damaging even we use protective cases.2.some times youtube crashes suddenly.need to restart the app again and again.3. 18 w fast charging was not enough.4.slippery.5.caunt use the mobile without mobile cases.

175,Ok product for the Price,4,Ok for the price. Camera quality is not good. Battery backup is average and performance is not bad,Customer , 4 December 2021
176,Power machine!!,4,"Simply a good value for money phone, one of the best in class devices overall. Processor performance is smooth & powerful. Display is fantastic, bright & vibrant. I wish the speakers were a little better. Love the connectivity options including WiFi & data tether together, which I missed in my older mobile once upgraded miui11, but it has been retained in this, which is awesome. Good cover in the box, turned yellow in two weeks but still tough & good quality. The blue variant looks good, I like the look of them all. The camera is perfect, I don't understand the criticism, maybe people don't know how to use them or expect some astronomical returns at this range, this camera beats the new flagship phones hands down. Ram & storage capacity is also top notch. I'm yet to find any flaw, hence really happy with it. A good upgrade for anyone looking for a versatile power machine.",Ravi Chandra, 30 July 2020

178,"Overall it is a good mobile, you will not regret after buying it 😊",5,"Redmi Note 8 Pro (8GB ram, 128 GB storage space) was my third Redmi mobile. Previously I had Redmi 3s prime, and Redmi 4.I am writing this review after using the phone for almost one week. I am a gaming freak. 😉Redmi Note 8 pro is one of the best mobile launched in the segment of below Rs. 20,000/-.Camera is very good, but it needs natural light to make the photo crystal clear. There are grains in the photo, even in 64 MP lens, if the photos are taken in the low light area. So you need ample amount of light to make the photo clear, I mean to make you love your photos. 😉Selfie camera is also very good, specially that bokeh mode 😍, but again the same, you need ample amount of light to make the photos crystal clear or else you will find grains in your photos.Performance is very good. Games like Pubg and Call of Duty Mobile can be played in High graphic without lag, but you should have decent internet speed. While playing games, the mobile heats up even though its has liquid cool technology. But this is a minor issue of high end gaming processor.Xiaomi offer a user friendly interface which I personally think is better than any other brand.Screen size is also big. It adds up to your entertainment.Face recognition feature needs to be a little advanced since it unlocks the device but does not remove the lock screen wallpaper.I personally like the halo white model because I myself bought it 😉 and I think its the better from the green and black one.",Aify, 12 November 2019
179,"Not the ""Beast"" in every expect i expected.",3,"everything is just fine. some things that i hate about this phone is that the video quality in room lighting and in night is worst like its 5mp camera it's just pathetic. daylight camera is good video is good although 4k recording is useless unless you use a stand to mount your phone on it's too shaky cuz lack of EIS.battery life is bad for a 4500mah battery.screen is good expect for the fact the video streaming on youtube really sucks like reallyy you'll hate it if you stream youtube alot although if you watch on 720p then no problem but im now used to it i don't see much difference. color reproduction of the screen is bad, black color find it difficult to make it's way out of ther colors viewing angles are fine but not okay for this price point.but when it comes to Gaming. this is some serious business, i must say this device has a lot of potential in performance. it's packed with latest g90t processor which makes pubg mobile more fascinating. you can play HDR on ultra frame rate for about 1 hour after that you can notice little bit frame drops but if you play on smooth and extreme frame rate which i think is the best option you'll notice that the game runs like water really smooth.Heating issue is not that much, after playing 3 matches it'll start to heat a little bit on back top corner but it's unnoticeable if you have a cover on the phone and the phone doesn't heat at all if you don't play games on it.",The Salvedad, 6 March 2020
180,Performance Beast For The Price,5,"The variant I bought was the 128GB storage with 6GB RAM in the Gamma Green colour.Design & Build: The colour and design of the back feels premium with Gorilla Glass 5 protection. The curved edge makes it comfortable to hold the phone even though it weighs more than an average phone. The weight distribution is done well.Display: The IPS LCD panel is excellent and feels premium. Measuring at 6.53"", it is definitely big but you'll get used to it. Or not.Performance: The new processor has silenced the critics with impeccable performance. I haven't noticed any stutters or glitches. Multitasking runs smoothly with good RAM management.Battery: 4500 mAh battery is a monster. I easily got 11-12 hrs of screen-on time with 30 mins of gaming. If you're a casual user, it could easily last two days on a single charge. The included 18W charger is an added bonus.Camera: The quad camera is good at the price range but nothing extraordinary. Low light photos are noisy and could be corrected with Gcam or future updates.Cons: 1) At 6.53"", forget about one handed use. So if size is a big deal for you, this isn't the best choice.2) MIUI and its ads. Fortunately you can turn off most of it and delete the bloatware.3) Camera isn't professional grade by any means. 64 MP is fine and all, but that should not be the deciding factor.Verdict: At this price point, I would definitely RECOMMEND this as it is a good all round phone. Performance wise, this is a BEAST. Gamma Green and Halo White are the best colours of the pack.",Mishal Mohammed, 26 November 2019

183,Nothing to complain about!! Must buy!!,5,"⛳️Posting the review after 7 months of extensive usage in lockdown period!!!Overall experience is great and there is nothing to complain about.Usage is for watching YouTube videos, OTT, playing games and for surfing social media. Have been using the mobile for listening songs 1 hr a day with Bluetooth headset and the experience is amazing. Will also advice on best headphones to be used with at the end of this review.Likes✅Why this phone was chosen? – Battery, camera, 2sims+1memory card slot, edge to edge display✅Camera- 5/5✅Build- 4.5/5 (Shining back panel is tough and is eye catching)✅Display-4.5/5✅Battery- 4.5/5✅Performance- 4.5/5✅Sound (Speaker phone) - 3.5/5✅Sound (headphones) - 5/5 (Better than most of the phones in this range)✅Fingerprint reader - 5/5 (fast and accurate)✅Heating – No heating✅Android version: Updated to 9✅Charging Speed – Fast Charging (Approx 1.15hrs for full charge) Cell comes with free cover which looks cool and can be used.🎧Headphones to be used – MI Basic (wired) and Boult Curve. Both provide satisfying sound experience📷The outdoor photography is crisp and colorful. Indoor photography can be little better but is fantastic at this price range.Attaching some photographs for your information.Dislikes❌Should have given free headphonesNo other Dislikes.👍👍Best budget phone for those who love gaming, photography and binge watching online content.👍👍",Abhijit, 9 June 2020
184,Honest and real review,5,"I would like to a honest review.1. Build quaility - 4.8/5. Because of too much bump of the camera , so be careful with that or use a good quality back cover for protection2. Camera - 5/5. Depth ,details can be seen very clearly, hdr is good nd because of hdr is available in all the way, wide angle is gud , macro lens is clear but not that much i expected but in this price range it is best, video at 4k overall good.3. Performance - the main and the foremost thing that everyone thinks about the perfomance, nd now this beast comes with Helio G90T which is too much powerful processor for gaming, multitasking , nd power packed work , pubg , cod  plays at higher resolution at ease . The best performance and gaming phone in this budget .4- Design - the back glass is with gorilla glass 5 and it luks amazing with 3 different colour i prefer white for attractive luk but for elegant luks u can go for gamma green.5- Battery & charging - it comes 4500 mah battery which works well a day or more , if u are heavy usager so it can give up to 1 day to u nd for normal users it can give more than a day . Charging is gud but 18 w charger seems to be more faster than it is. It takes around 2 hours to charge from 2% to 100% .Overall i think at this price range redmi note 8 pro is the king of all or u can say a beast .....",Mayank j., 19 November 2019
185,The Great Budget Phone with Good Features.,4,"The Redmi Note 8 Pro is a great phone for the price tag.The Camera is very good although rumours would suggest otherwise so don't believe in those. It is not flagship grade but for selfies and photography the camera is almost as good as a flagship phone.The fingerprint reader is a problem since it is located near the camera, and unless you properly register your entire finger it can be a little problematic to unlock but once properly registered the scanner is definitely faster than the indisplay/optical fingerprint scanner.The phone has a decent battery life and can last about 12 to 15 hours on heavy usage otherwise the battery lasts for 24 hours on normal use. Also this phone does not heat up under heavy use because of the Liquid cooling system inside.Overall the phone is worth the price although the multitasking could be better and an Amoled Display or Oled Display would be better it is still a good phone until the next generation budget phone comes out.4 out of 5 stars.",Daneya Dcosta, 2 March 2020
186,Worth for a Money,4,"1) Performance : performance is very good processor is optimised perfectly, no lag or any issue while doing day to day activities, found some lag when playing high end games2) Battery: Battery lasts for 12-14 hours for normal use & 5-6 hours for heavy use like playing pubg but fast charger in box can charge battery in 120 mins in full3) Display: Display is good but not that great, it has FHD support...only HD video content is viewed better4) Heating Issue: it has minor heating issue while playing high end games but cools down very quickly when you take some break5) Camera: Camera is best in this price range, you will have multiple options to take great photos & Videos6) Downloading content: Download speed is really shocked me, you can download very fast at 5hz7) Additional points: phone is little bit bulky with 200 grams weight & 6.5 screen size (not for small hand, one hand use), little dispoint with heating issue while playing pubg (as I purchased phone for playing games) when phone gets heat up it tends to lag with very high settings(what's use of high settings in phone if you can't play continuously)Please like my comment...",Nitin Shinde, 12 November 2019

188,Amazing phone and value for money,4,"I am writing this review after using Note 8 pro for almost 3 weeks. Here are my likes and dislikes:Likes:1. Camera is superb. 64M and Macro are just amazing. Selfie shots are also very nice.2. Performance is superb. No lag at all. I have played most of the heavy games like asphalt and pubg etc..3. Touch is flawless and fingerprint is really fast.4. Display is big and bright. I like it although its not AMOLED.5. Battery is fairly good enough for one day backup with heavy usage.6. Charging is fast and gets full charged from 10% to 70% in nearly 40mins.Dislikes:1. Little heavy. U will feel its weight if using single handed.2. Gets warm around camera when camera is in continued use for some time. Also, night shots are noisy and lack details.3. Ultra wide gives really wide angle but with lesser details.4. Unwanted MI apps and ads which u can't stop and uninstall.Finally, Note 8 pro is really the best phone by Xiaomi in note series till now. Camera and performance are really fabulous. Only downside according to me is weight and gets warm around camera.",Amaz_Customer2506, 18 November 2019
189,Champion budget smart phone with higher aspirations,4,Review after one week of extensive usage.Pros:- Super smooth functioning.- Great battery life; charging after 1.5 days.- MIUI is smooth and intuitive. Be careful during initial setup and you can remove the ads.- Screen is bright and great for watching videos and reading e-books. Brightness under sun is very good.- Front camera is great and portrait mode works perfectly.- Front camera works perfectly during day light. All modes including portrait works like dream.- Phone build quality is top notch. Its sturdy and easy to hold. Green colour looks superb.- Fast charge is really fast and difference with other phones is noticable.Cons:- Night mode not upto the mark. Grainy and distorted picture. Processing is slow as well.- Indoor photography under ambient light is good but could have been better.- While playing heavy games or watching netflix for longer duration (>30min) leads to phone heating up. It cools down pretty quickly though.Overall a great package. Truly value for money. Personally i am loving it and would totally recommend anyone looking for a phone in the range of <20k,Amazon Customer, 21 November 2019
190,Great value for Money,5,"This phone provides an awesome value at its price. The phone looks and feels premium a bit heavy just because of that 4500 mah battery but it feels a lot heavier than it actually is just because of it's weight is more on the bottom side. Now the cameras it has a great versatile camera setup on the back but i feel the ultrawide shots could have been better also the night mode does not have any details just because it is just increasing the iso too much to compensate for low light however google camera makes things better. Talking about google camera lets talk about development for the mediatek helio G90t processor that's powering up the show, the chip is excellent be it gaming or regular day to day task G90t blazes through everything. Also there are many good Gcams available for this device but no custom roms as of now, however Xiaomi is trying a lot to make things better. And the display that is i feel the most interesting part of this device i compared the display of this device with realme Xt's display to be very honest i feel the colors are a bit better on redmi while the contrast of that amoled pannel is just awesome on XT but the HDR video playback supports makes things a bit better but still those inky blacks are just awesome. Also the bezels are very thin on this device so much that while watching a youtube video you sometimes skip the video just because your hand was touching the display. But overall the device is Excellent but could have been better.",Swatantra, 12 December 2019
191,Initial Impressions ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,4,"Hi,Here are my initial impressions of Redmi Note 8 pro -1. The phone built quality is really good! ✔️I use OnePlus 7 as my daily driver and I have no issues with built quality of this phone ✔️2. I don't like MI UI much ❌ so I installed Poco Launcher and use one UI icon pack from playstore to give the phone a nice feel. ✔️3. Moving on to display, there is no need to worry. It's an IPS display but does the job well ✔️ No complains here. ✔️4. Camera performance can be subjective -  I have attached pictures of a plant taken by all lenses (main, telephoto, ultrawide and macro) + a portrait shot also. Overall camera - 4/5 ⭐5. I experienced no issues with Alexa app so far. Some reviewers had mentioned some problems but I didn't experience any. ✔️6. Change the haptic motor / feedback settings to light and it will be good. It comes at medium settings by default which doesn't feel that good.Overall great value for money ( easy 4.5+/5 ) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  #Highly Recommended",Vatsal Satija, 5 December 2019
192,A very decent phone with excellent features. But camera isn't that great.,4,"Looks: 5/5 (Good and slim phone)Ergonomics: 4.5/5 (placement of FP scanner is quiet annoying)UI: 5/5 (I believe that MiUi is best ever designed UI. Simple yet powerful. Not much of junks pre-installed)Camera: 4/5 (As a professional photographer, i merely enjoyed clicking with wide angle camera. Images are not as expected. But 64mp rocks, the best camera out of remaining three or technically 2. Bcuz one is a depth sensor. As I'm not find of selfie, i cannot comment on front camera. But it's good as i use it for video calling.)Storage: 5/5 (128GB for me is enough as I organise my files.)Battery: 4.5/5 (Good backup, but quiet slow charging when compared to my previous phone or atleast that's what my experience says)Hardware: 5/5 (No lags or heating issues, but had heating issues initially while setting up the phone)Screen: 5/5 (Smooth and good. Quiet realistic colors when compared to some of the over saturated phones.)Sound: 3.5/5 (very low sound. But if used with a good earphones, it gives a better experience)Overall a better phone in its range and good buy.",Guru, 2 January 2020
193,A good camera phone with not so good processor.,4,"After Using this phone since 2 months.i would say.1.The processor is not for gamers. It gets heaten up quickly.2.Mediatek processor is not the right choice.3.Camera is good. 64 mp camera is a good boost to its features.4.the other cameras, wide angeled and macro are also good one.5.battery life is Ok. Because of its hdr display battery drains a bit quicker. Moreover, mediatek processor also takes a lot of battery to work.6. Howsoever, battery is 4500 mah which means it will definitely work the whole day and a half in a single charge.7. Front camera is very nice. Very sharp images can be shot.8. Video recording in hdr 1080 pixels, is nice to see.9. Night mode camera is not up to the mark.10. The design. - the glass body looks so premium and shiny . The only problem i have is with the protruding cameras behind. Why is it so i don't know. It hurts the cameras while placing on a table and so it hurts me.",apoorva shrimali, 5 March 2020
194,Very good hardware and quality from Xiaomi,4,"Phone comes in with Android 9 and MiUI 10. Latest update to MiUi 11. Good camera and Ads can be disabled while booting the phone for the first time. Full HD+ Display Res could have been much better. PPI is reduced to 395 when compared to the redmi note 7 pro which had 409, doesn't make a huge difference but adjusts to full brighteness in daylight. Fingerprint is really spot on and fast. Apps load in quick and RAM management is pretty good. Have been using it for more than 2 weeks. Call quality is good and battery is pretty good, 18W charger and charges completely from 0-100 in 1:50 hrs. I get two complete days of battery backup on frequent browsing and operating the phone. Also comes in with the lasted RAM and UFS storage. Gorilla glass 5 front and back. Only disadvantage is that the phone weighs close to 200 gms and feels heavier on single hand usage. Camera is decent and if you are a professional photographer you can switch over to Pro mode. Overall a satisfied and good purchase for a budget phone.",Nicholas, 27 November 2019
195,Note 8 pro does what it says except battery backup!,4,"A great phone in this budget. After a week's time, my experience is good except for the battery performance and fingerprint sensor position. A battery of new phone having just one day life after full charge is something unexpected keeping in view I am a moderate user and dont play pubg or games.Secondly, position of fingerprint sensor is prehistoric. How can designer make such mistake by aligning camera and fingerprint sensor in one single line and that too at the back of the phone.This bad alignment ignites chances of contamination of lenses while one tries to unlock phone using finger and yeah not to forget our fingers are often dirty, aren't they 😜.Well now comes camera which is fabulous. 64 megapixel does wonders exactly the way manufacturer describes.Also, phone dimensions are little exaggerated but one can always use ""One-handed operation"" feature and you will start loving the length and breadth of it instantly.Overall a nice budget phone and worth buy !!Let me know if you would like to hear about any other feature. Take care of your eyes and thumb 😊.Happy phoning 👍",anurag, 14 January 2020
196,Best phone under 18k,4,Good smartphone under budget.,sharan, 5 January 2022
197,Casting feature and service needs improvement,4,"The phone has almost all the feature which one can expect. It has much space, fast mobile charging, fingerprint sensor, quickly face recognize, Alexa, Google Assistant, Screen Recorder, Nice cameras, Good look and feel.Few things needs to be considered more -1. Casting feature needs improvement, the mobile screen does not get cast directly. Tried all the way even by connecting the mobile and TV with same WIFI. I wrote to Redmi service twice but they did not respond at all. Casting only work from Google Photo and YouTube application directly and that too lagging in voice and picture.2. Too much MI applications preinstalled, you may need to remove them once you receive the phone.3. Whatever app you install, all those are put on desktop. There is nothing where Apps are put inside and only shortcuts are put on home screen.",Vinod Gupta, 22 June 2020

201,Excellent 👌,5,It's been 2 years since i bought it. And never once it came to my mind that i need to get a new handset. And i think it will be like that for the next 1 or 2 years. Fully satisfied for the price i paid.,akshoyraj phukon, 3 February 2022

203,Redmi note 8 pro full review before you buying,5,Best screen ever in redmi note series and i love camera in day light but nigh photography is average only because redmi note 8 pro night mode it take smooth photos which i don't like but i know how to fix I'm using pro mode this will helping to take better photos at night and performance is top notch you never fell any lag in this phone because this phone have powerful gaming chip this chip gpu and cpu is useing expensive phone for example Samsung & Huawei i love performance g90t and battery life give me 23 hours screen on time this will great because I'm very havy user I'm playing pubg mobile 3 hours battery lost only 32%In my redmi note 8 pro and 1 day battery easily giving you but company claim under 2 hours fully charged but don't have any problems i love changing speed because battery life is longer so i like battery of redmi note 8 pro and the heating issue people say this will heat but don't feel heating issue because I know redmi devices have warning sign across the overheating scenario but my device is only heat 42°C But 5 minut later phone is cool down so fast show this is not a heating issue because every expensive phone will all so heat i don't think any major issues so you can buy this phone 👍♥️😍 full details reviews of redmi note 8 pro -- faster & smoother ⚡⚡,ANMOL SINGH, 8 February 2020
204,Best deal for the price,4,The Phone is a great deal at this price point. Like every other phone this phone is also not perfect out of the box. One is aware that MI offers great price and good quality with a few compromises.I give a quick pros and cons after using this for past 3 months.Pros:Awesome display with HDR supportPretty good camera especially portrait selfie modeCall quality is goodBattery backup is excellentDesign is stylishRAM management due to 6 GB ramDedicated SD card slotGaming is smoothQuick chargingCons:Gets heated at timesFingerprint sensor was hit n miss initiallyDevice is slightly big and heavy. Makes single hand use difficultStill no Android 10Wide angle lens is a gimmick and night mode is not that greatSometimes when more calls are taken battery drains ( I guess it's normal but was worth mentioning)Ads there are loads even after disabling.Overall a good phone to have.,Pranjal Pandey, 1 March 2020
205,Ultimate beast,5,"I'll give a realistic review of this phone since im using it for a week.Bad stuff:1. Phone gets a bit warm after playing heavy games for an hour or so.2. Highly annoying camera bump and weird placement of fingerprint scanner.3. Bit of ads but that can be dealt with4. Phone is bit heavy weighs close to 200gms. Suits for people with big hands. It suited for me5. IPS LCD display,  looks clear and sharp but not better than sAmoled screen.6. Doesn't play HD videos for Prime and netflix, i guess it will be addressed theough software update.Good stuff:1. This is an ultimate gaming beast. All the games runs so smooth whatever you throw to it.2. Day to day tasks are great and faster!! No lag whatsoever!3. Amazing camera quality both rear and front.4. Lightning speed fingerprint scanner.5. Charging is quite fast with 18w charger.6. Excellent battery life. Comes to solid two days inspite of playimg games.7. Amazing network reception and call quality.8. WiFi calling enabled.9. Sturdy build quality. No compromise here. Gorilla glass all the way!10. The touch sensitivity is great on this mobile.Overall verdict: If you are a gamer and looking forbthe beat gaming phone belown15k, this is it. Go for it blindly! But if you are into watching videos, i would prefer the m30s. But trust me.. for 15k, this is a steal!! Go for it guys!",Dinz, 11 January 2020
206,A request and a complain to do Amazon about redmi note 8 Pro,4,I feel in redmi note 8 Pro that the battery is going so faster and if you are not using the data  its it is being lessed and and the processor is being slow while I am playing pubg is getting too much of leg and it is structThe phone is at least good but this kind of thing is irritating me so much so I buy this phone from December and till now two times I have reached reset this phone and even if the 50 percentage of storage is full also it is showing that it is it is slow and  it is taking too much of time to get the apps and the if you have to service the phone we didn't get any information of that where is the nearest service centre or like that I feel little sad about this redmi note 8 Pro and redmi company,Jonathan, 16 April 2020
207,Awesome purchase,5,"After 2 years of mid to heavy usage, It's still in great condition. It heats up quite a bit when playing games in high resolution, but other than that it runs smoothly. One charge will last for 12-16 hours of high performance gaming and in case of mid-low usage it can easily last for 2 days.",Software developer, 9 January 2022

209,😀Overall it is best one 😀,4,"Good smart phone in this price range ,I think this is better than realme X T,good battery level . facing main problem is heating issue ...phone working 30 minutes after increase the temperature level in 29 to 40c.camera is good performance but low light conditions is bad .phone sound is normal (not loud).micro camera is average performance. Design and build quality is very good. I think face look is too slow redmi note 5 Pro is better than redmi note 8 Pro I think redmi note 5 Pro is very fast face unlock and redmi note 8 Pro is slow compared between redmi note 5 Pro. Fostering is very bad compared to realme xt, I think 8 Pro take 2 hours and 10 minutes in full charge.and gaming experience was very good no lakh very smooth to play any games.Design and build quality  10 /10Battery performance 8/10Front camera 8/10Back camera 9/10fingerprint sensor 10/10Fast charging 6/10Alexa 10/10Processor helio g90 t -10my personal opinion is in this price range this phone was very good.😀",Amal Ajith, 9 November 2019
210,Poor Man's iPhone!!!,5,"Butter smooth! That's my feedback in one word.What I like1. So smooth and lag free, never seen in any other android phones that I had used2. All 5 cameras. Esp loved the macro cam.3. Stunning display4. Super fast finger print and face unlock5. Lots of RAM and storage, plus I can add mmc6. Super fast charger and long lasting battery, with moderate usage - around 20mts calls + 4hrs FB/whatsapp + 2hrs streaming videos - still left me with more than 50% battery charge7. IR blaster8. Love the MIUI. My previous photoes were  Samsung and Motos. Now feeling that MIUI is better than stock, at least the initial thoughts.9. Better signal reception.What I don't like1. Position of finger print scanner is close to camera module, threat to camera2. The flashlight looks inadequate. This is compared to my previous phones with dual flash, though.3. Lots of unwanted apps, but not a big issue. Can uninstall almost all of them4. The much hyped  64 mp camera. I don't see much difference in photos from its normal mode and 64mp mode. Only that we can zoom a bit more.5. Fear of unknown. Will Xiomi collect my personal information, without my knowledge and what do they do with it? Beter watch some youtube videos on how to set the privacy settings during initial login itself.Those who are looking for a lag free mid range phone can surely buy this. I honestly recommend this phone. Great buy.",Rex Thomas, 6 November 2019
211,Received very good product.,5,I am writing this review intentionally after an year.Product recieved was in excellent condition.Packaging was goodRear Camera quality is great.Front is little bit low but works.Features are good.Hold is good.Same plastic build.Same MI Os.Charging time is pretty quick.Not good for Pubg like games.Build material is not that good.Too much ads comes with this phone.Auto apps installation even after disabling many ads and app itself gives lot of irritation.,Shubham Aggarwal, 18 September 2021
212,"Value of money, nice to use",4,"All most 2years over battery life is good, finger print is ok stasified, back camera quality is good but selfie camera quality very bad",udhaya, 27 October 2021
213,A super amazing phone with super amazing colours and super amazing processor. And Alexa too!,5,"Quite a thing that is made by MI!It is an amazing phone with brilliant colours. I purchased electric blue (6 GB+128 GB) and the colour is super awesome. The camera quality is excellent. Slow motion videos are of smaller length, but it is enough as what it provided. It has Alexa in-built, what else does a techie want? Also, Amazon made the delivery in time, as promised.If you're thinking on buying this phone, just go for it. Totally satisfied!Edit 1 (7 June 2020): I purchase one more phone from this range, the one with 8 GB +128 GB variant in black colour.There are a lot of reviews out there saying it has heating problem. This phone heats a little beside the camera. But trust me, the battery backup of this phone is amazing. It lasts for 5 hours when I play pubg continuously.Go for it without a doubt!Hint (for people comparing this phone with Redmi Note 9 Pro Max): If you're thinking of comparing Redmi Note 8 Pro with Redmi Note 9 Pro Max, then please go for the Redmi Note 9 Pro Max because it has as Octa Core Processor Snapdragon 720G in which 6 cores are of 1.8 GHz and other two cores are of 2.3 GHz.There is a lot of confusion going on in the market. Beware!",Shaheen, 23 January 2020
214,Good product,5,It's been more than 2 years I'm using this product still working very fine .I bought it in diwali 2019 .I use my mobile really roughly always storage is full overloaded with apps use mobile for gaming video editing photo shop and what not but Till date it has hanged only 5-6times .Happy with this product.,Jayprakash Nage, 18 December 2021
215,Awesome phone but buy from official website Amazon is slow,4,"Pros :Elegant designBeautiful color (depends on individual choices)Super fast tasksSmooth workingDoesn't have heat problem due to liquid coolingCamera is very good( considering the 16k budget)Cons:1.Buy from MI store,not amazon. Very late delivery ( 7days) , that's too longOnly 1 reputed seller so go buy it from mi store2. Alexa not that efficient, maybe because of the device or internet. Not sure yet.Doesn't work as good as the other Amazon echo dot products. Maybe that's why it's not available in note 9 pro3. Quad camera design looks cool but it's a little outside of phone's body so u have to be careful about not damaging it** Will update if something else comes to notice**Overall will rate 9/10",Dipankar , 23 June 2020
216,A very good choice under 20000,4,"I have been using the redmi note 8 pro for a week and what i find interesting in this phone is its battery backup which is very good, as if i dont play a lot of games the charge will remain for atleast 2 days straight and it does charge up pretty fast aswell .Fingerprint reader is fast, i have a sweaty hand so even with some amount of wetness it will recognise my finger which is good compared to all the previous budget phones i have used.Now coming to the camera the picture quality is very nice. In daylight pictures taken are beautiful and the night time clicks too come in quite nicely.For gaming side the chipset is nicely performing it does not produce any lag for games like asphalt 9, pubg mobile(not ultra HD graphics, which I haven't tried yet).Overall this is a good phone with more than average specs and performance standing up to the given specifications.",Ananthan M, 2 January 2020
217,successful two years completed with this handset first time,4,as all ways experience was amazing.,mac, 13 December 2021
218,Best budget phone with all latest technology,5,"One of the best smartphone to buy. The cons I faced with this phone are:1. It is heavy for one hand usage (weight).2. Network reception is having issue, it keeps switching between 4g volte and 3g while on call and will endup getting disconnected while on 30+ mins call.3. Even though I unselect adds/ pre installed apps while setup, it will be having list of pre loaded apps which on single tap will start getting installed. Need to remove all the unwanted apps4. Heats near rear camera and near proximity sensor while gaming5. Stock Camera is sometimes better sometimes not, we can install gcam as alternate for better snaps.Apart from these rest anything that comes under a phone are pros!! The one best part of this phone is processor and along with that 6/128 version gives the best never lagging performance. Battery life is averaging to 1.5 days on regular usage. 18w charger after android 10 update takes 1.2 hours for full charge from 15% to 100. Speaker is good and especially headphones effect is really good.Overall I would rate this phone 4.5/5",Ashwin, 19 July 2020
219,Reasonable Product,4,Great product in this range.1. This is a gaming powerhouse. I bought the 6GB+128 GB variant and play PUBG regularly for about 2-3 hours. I have good experience with that thus far. You can easily play 2 hours in HD graphics at the cost of just 25-30% of battery.2. The MediaTek processor has performed well so far. There's liquid cooling as well as the manufacturer claims.3. Camera is great including the Night Mode.4. Have used this for about a month now and see minimal heating issues so far.5.Battery drains a little faster while doing video calls/watching videos. You have 18W in-the-box fast charger which can completely charge up your phone in about 2 hours from 0 to 100%Overall : Go for it,SARANSH CHOUDHARY, 4 July 2020

222,Really Good and Cheap for what it has to offer,5,"I did a lot of research before buying this phone.I'm happy I picked it up. It's been months and I love it.I switched over from Apple which was huge for me. There are quite a few differences.You can't get your apple backup onto an Android phone. So I lost my whatsApp data. But I shifted my contacts to my SIM so was able to get at least that. Other than that, I started from scratch, downloading my apps and signing in to all of them.But I absolutely love the phone.Battery lasts a day and a half.Dropped it a couple of times, but I have a case and tempered glass. It's all still intact.Huge amount of storage.Great camera.Works fast. No lags.Great features to share images and videos directly to a wide range of apps.My only issues are minor:WhatsApp video camera quality is weird. Very poor.Can't save single videos on whatsapp. Have to turn on save to gallery for all media.It's really an amazing phone and it's so cheap for what it has to offer.",PeasInAPod, 4 June 2020
223,Read thoroughly,5,"Using it for past 4 daysVarious others wrote about camera qualities. Would like to say that is not a professional camera guys, but yes, out of all available camera mobiles in the market this is the forerunner for sure. The camera lens of redmi note 8 pro quality beats allNow coming to those aspects which are never discussedThe color gamuts are absolutely brilliant with the highest pixel quality available in this range (better than maby top gun brands)Ram speed, your brain may take a little longer to think your name than the ram of this phone to performAlexa works even in display off mode superbly, which is the added advantageProcessing speed is just tremendous, so forget any lagging issuesBattery as quoted here is true and not exaggerated (though i would have been more happy if they could have upgraded the battery longetivity of 6000 mAh)Wifi and wireless are just tremendously fast.Coming to the consOnce again about the battery, they may have increased that to earn the added advantage of samsung m30sPhone cover is a must guys, the ultra stylish look made it slippery to touchThe c type for data transfer, they should have provided connector for micro and usb with the c type (i bought both from market @40 and 60)Final verdict, go for it, woth every penny that u invest in it",Ansuman, 3 December 2019

225,Need some software update in camera for sure,4,"Overall a good phone . Good built quality good display  great battery life.. nice fingerprint sensor overall UI is also gd call quality is also very good .. weight balance is outstanding.. but there are some cons also the camera quality is very disappointing . Front camera is good but slightly over saturated and beauty filters. .. but the rear one  omg.... Definitely not looking like a 64mp cam photo... Clarity is not upto the mark, colours are not real😑, dark green colour looking like grass green .. and even the 64 mp pic is not so clear.... One other problem is audio output quality not that much louder. .. another one major issue with auto brightness mode.. its hardly visible when you are in adark room ...",Sandeep Kumar swain, 1 June 2020
226,Especially for Redmi Lovers,4,"Nowadays, Redmi is the brand which sets a benchmark for other brands in this crowded lower midrange phones. These benchmarks are highly competant to other OEMs. The Helio G90T is a fantastic Gaming chip which supports full capabilities in any mode. The gameplay is buttery smooth, and sustained higher frame rates, liquid cooling all are clearly helping for good gaming experience. Redmi showed that, just we don't need a gamecentric phones which 2x or 3x more expensive. The only thing scratching my head is, when they gonna give a AMOLED display in this segment. MI A3 is good phone but it's not well rounded. Note 8 pro is a good phone who are seeking it for games, bcoz everyone now asking is this phone good for PUBG, bcoz smooth gameplay refers to a good GPU. The GPU in Note 8 pro is an odd pearl in the midrange segment. Thats it!.",Ajithkumar, 6 December 2019
227,Better options are available,4,"Review after 1 month: The phone hasn't disappointed me with anything. I had to buy this urgently because my previous phone was dead. Otherwise I would have opted for the Realme X2 or the Poco X2 which launched after I purchased this. This one is pretty good but as I mentioned above, there are better options. Battery life is good. Easily lasts a day. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully charge from 10%. Performance has been superb and multitasking, seamless. Camera quality is average. Don't believe the 64 MP camera hype. Display is big and very good even though it's an LCD display. The phone does get warm but nothing to make you uncomfortable. All in all, it's a good purchase but not the best one in this price bracket. Consider other ones if your budget is around 15k.",Prashant, 26 February 2020
228,BEST VALUE FOR MONEY!,5,"I'm writing this review after 1 year plus usuage of the phone. Phone is good, still takes good pictures, I did some astrophotography with it and macro lens is just a blessing. Overall design is also quite modern and classy . The only con it feels a bit slippery without any back cover so keep that in mind but I guess that's because of the glass back. The screen is quite good and very tough. I have dropped this phone mistakenly a lot of time on floor (with marble), and it didn't get a scratch. The reason I bought this over the redmi note 8 was simply because I had in mind a phone that wiil last me long and I think this will definitely go strong for the next 3 years.",Ankit Josh, 3 February 2021
229,The best for the buck,4,You give the phone in a rich guys hand and he'll be ready to pay more than 20k. Literally anybody who held this phone had their moment of surprise when i told it's specs and the price. I did quite feel special at the moment.1.Ads? Didn't find any. You can turn off the app recommendations in the app itself2.Gaming- This phone is a champ in handling games. Can play PUBG upto HDR+Ultra.3.Battery- Let me get down to the reason I gave it a 4 star. Even though it has fast charging capability and has a fast charger included I'm still not able to to understand the 2hrs of charging time it takes. Could be faster. The battery lasts you for a day and more4. Camera- Better than any competition in the price range. 64MP is a no joke. It has EIS and videos look butter smooth on 1080p 60fps.,Shon Mendonca, 8 November 2019
230,Good phone with great battery life,4,"Overall I am very happy with the purchase.Pros:Camera - 64MP pictures captures lot of detail, slow motion video recording is also very good - can record at different speeds, using it at highest speed is tricky as it only records last few seconds at that speed.Screen display - color and brightness is goodBattery + Quick charge, 8GB RAM is awesomeStorage of 128 GB sufficient for me, did not have to put memory cardGot update for Andriod :)Cons:MIUI - My first phone with MIUI - I don't quite like it, had to customize a lot to reduce clutter on screen.Too many bundled apps which you cannot get rid of.",Janardhan, 26 June 2020
231,Go with caution,4,"Initial review: Very good phone in this range. Amazing camera zooming. Cons is like you can not zoom while you are taking picture in 64 MP mode. Also, video is not allowed in 64 MP.Charger is not very high quality as we see now in this range of other phones. I will give 4.5out of 5.After 4 months use review : phone battery sometimes drains like anything and in max 6 hours it turns to zero from hundred. But sometimes it will run for 1.5 days as well. Not more than that. You have to mandatorily give permissions to all MI apps specially MI Browser otherwise your phone will always be very hot and battery will drain like rain. Sometimes it gets hanged also and taken almost 30 seconds to resume. Changing my 5 start rating to 4 star.Thanks",Alok Mishra, 4 March 2020

235,Good gaming phone.,4,"Really good product for this price range. Battery life is good, gets me through a day. For light users it can last up to 24hrs.Camera needs improvement and bug fix, software processing is really not that good, not as good as Redmi note 7 pro. Sharpness is too high on this phone, has too much noice, it's pretty unusable. Heavy software processing on Manuel camera too. No option for raw capture, all the other phones at this price range has raw capture.This camera has a major fault!!If you don't care that much about camera, then it's a really good phone. A little bugs here and there, it might be fixed with MIUI11.Great as a gaming device.If you want a good camera phone with a decent processor, go for the Redmi note 7 pro or note 8 or realmi XTFor samples on me on telegram @thepicmind",Anandha Krishnan, 19 November 2019

Camera quality also suffers during wide angle shot.In summary it's good for gaming and taking photo in daylight. hope they will fix streaming quality issues in next update.",Chinmay, 10 February 2020
237,Good to buy at this spec and price,4,"Redmi Note 8 Pro offers a 64MP camera and the clarity of the camera is pretty decent, the front camera offers a 20MP selfie camera which is great while taking selfies. The performance of the phone is smooth and for gaming. The experience is also pretty good as there is a liquid cooling technology is used. It had built-in Alexa to control the smart devices which respond instantly. The storage capacity is also large and allows us to extend up to 512GB.Android Pie operating system is equipped for this device. The 4500mAH battery offers a decent backup for the phone. The 3D-curve design is good to hold the phone in hand to operate. Overall the phone is good to buy at this spec and price.",Vivek Techie, 1 June 2020

242,Good!,4,"After using the note 8 for a week here's my take:Pros1. Display screen is massive2. Battery is more than adequate. After repeated use it is yet to drain in a 24 hour window.3. Hardware is awesome. Response time to sensors, screen input, camera etc are super fast.Cons1. I do not like the MIUI. This is where the Korean's are great at tuning their one ui.2. Vibration in silent mode needs improvement.3. Do not use themes. It made my notification on the lock screen to disappear. Had to reset the phone all over again.4. Speaker is not too loud. It's just OK.5. Wide angle camera is more like a fish lense camera. The subjects on the extreme ends of the shot are bloated up to accommodate them in the frame.Overall at this price you need to be satisfied. I am happy.",LJ , 15 November 2019
243,awesome product,5,"After 1 month of usage, here's my reviewPros:-1) processor is powerful, mediatek helio g90t is faster than Snapdragon 665, 675, 730g... only Snapdragon 8 series is ahead of g90t. App launching time is really fast2)Full hd display is really good. ultra thin bezels give a premium look.3)since it has a gaming processor, GPU is awesome pubg, cod mobile runs at ultra hd butter smooth4) battery life is good enough, even after heavy gaming and continuous usage of facebook, youtube with data connection, lasts almost 1.5 days5)camera has 960 fps slow motion video recording, macro lens, wide angle lens and the 64 mp monster takes ultra high quality images, even after zooming in u can see all tiny details clearly. selfie cam is also nice. photo taken in complete darkness with flash on is not at all grainy6)6gb ram can handle heavy games and multiple apps simultaneously. Heavy games like asphalt9, cod dont relaunch after minimising and launching other apps like fb, youtube, chrome7)phone doesnt heat much while playing heavy games, even after 30 mins of intense gaming, the back of the phone is just mildly warm, but heats more when gaming while chargingCons:-1)screen size(6.53 inch) is big and difficult to use one handed2)some people complain about bloatware and annoying ad notifications, but you can uninstall them",Kiranraj, 29 November 2019
244,Excellent,5,"Excellent build quality considering its price . Looks premium in hand . Fingerprint reader is fast and accurate but the placement could have been better , after using it for some days , it's ok for me.  With 4G network for mobile internet, comes for one full day whereas if I use wifi it last for two days . Camera is amazing considering the price . Both front and back camera takes photos with natural color . Night sight is average . Video has stabilization and retains good dynamic range . Overall paisa vasool . Also software updates are ok so far . Got one major software update 9 to 10 . Waiting for Android 11 . Regarding the ads, if u stop recommendations in all system apps, u will not get single ad. So far i didn't see any ads on my phone .",Basheer Ahamed, 26 October 2020
245,My Redmi Note 8 pro experience of 1 month,4,"Phone performance is good but I'm facing little gestures issue on note 8 pro like phone backled get power off during call and it gets power on only by pressing Power button, it seems like proximity sensor is not working normally. Automatically cleaning cache feature is not working resulting phone is being hanged until cache is not clean manually. Rest of performance is good.. phone camera is better if I compared with other redmi phones but not up to the marks as per it's marketing.Battery performance is also not up to mark as expected, giving less than a day battery backup if I use phone with internet browsing or watching videos online. Overall performance is good but It can be better as phone features are excellent so some issues might be resolved in upcoming MIUI updates.",Vinod K., 27 February 2020

247,Performance Beast. Killer Cameras.,5,"Probably the best phone under 15k or even 20k, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that. Yes, it lacks a few things like an AMOLED display, Inbuilt fingerprint Scanner which it's competitors offer, but still this phone beats them when it comes to overall performance, the Mediatek Helio G90T processor is no joke, this thing scored 28-29k on Antutu benchmark, way ahead than the phones offered on even greater budgets. I don't play games, but the overall performance is very fluidic when heavily multitasked. The camera is another plus point, day light shots are phenomenal, low light shots are good, but the tables turn when you install GCAM! Yes, the phone now supports GCAM fully right out of the box. You just need to install it along with a proper configuration file. That's it, go for this your eyes closed. I'm a neophyte when it comes to clicking pictures, but you can do better. So, attaching a few shots, shot with GCAM astrophotography mode.Edit: Love this phone even more, learnt to click pictures in pro mode, and surprisingly I think they are even better than GCAM low light shots; I have added a few more pictures for you to see.",Rangnayaki Kumari, 2 March 2020

250,AUTHENTIC REVIEW - Being a Redmi Note 8 pro user for 4 months,3,"PROS:1. Battery - 5/5 ( battery is really good like a normal user can run without charging for more than 1 day ,it's amazing2. Chipset /processor - 4/5#Helio G90T is amazing,it doesn't usually lag much but it do lag sometimes, not a big deal though.3. Camera - For rear camera 4.5/5For selfie camera 3/5 # if you are selfie lover this phone is not for you and I mean it. Rear camera is excellent with details and clarity but it lags color punchiness. And for selfie ,it's poor with details and colors are simply rubbish.4. Design - 5/5 it's really sleek and thin phone. It comes with a gorilla glass coating at back which is great. I have white phone it looks amazing.5. SOUND - 5/5 Excellent sound with satisfactory clarity.6. Finger scanner - it's blazing fast. Can even detect with slight moisture in fingers.CONS 1. Color display - IPS LCD display is a major drawback for this phone. Personally I'm a Netflix binge watcher so I really regret for this display.Better go for amoled display phones.( Vivo S1 pro  is good) This is so far the only problem I've faced .If you are okay with the display and not a selfie freak this phone is for you.",Yadavendra Yadav, 3 July 2020
251,Loved it ♥️,5,"After using 2 weeks i can honestly say that this phone is amazing at this price segment. Some of its pros and cons are....Pros..# The given processor mediatek helio g90 t is an awsm gaming processor more over it gives ur day to life apps a smooth experience.# Charging speed is good.# finally go for its best knowing feature its quad camera, it's really mind blowing some of reviewers r saying that camera quality is not good. I think they r expecting DSLR @15000.But in my opinion it's good camera setup u can go for it. Some of pictures captured by note 8 pro itself  I'm sharing.# Screen is better as compared to other ips display phones there is minor difference between its display and smiled display pannel. Colour pretty good and vibrant.#Colour it's gamma green clr is awsm I fallen love with it.Cons.# Little bit heating issue is there while playing heavy graphic games as pubg cod ...# Alexa feature some times doesn't work properly.#Finger print scanner (I think ) is not mounted at right place.# Camera bump much bigger.# Phone's weight is much heavy.Overall conclusion guys this the best phone at this price segment u can go for it. It's worth of money.",vivek y., 3 December 2019
252,"Good Looks, Performance, Sturdy. A Good performer",4,Review based on a few days of usage. Used by my Dad (75 of age)Colour: Halo WhitePerformance:4/5Battery: 4/5 (1.5 days for his usage)Camera: 4/5 (a little over exposure when unbalanced sunlight; a good macro image)Screen: 5/5The phone look gives a premium feel especially in the Halo White colour. The phone in hand is a good feel and the finger print unlock was easy to access. Screen is crisp and clear. The Camera is very good at the price and good for mobile use. (Haven’t used it elsewhere). The MIUI is an interface I like and no problems there. Comes with MIUI 10 and updates to 11. Waiting for Android 10 update officially.,Niragi Bhonsle, 10 June 2020

256,Excellent Phone in thi Budget,5,"After using 2 months here is my view.Display - 5/5Processor - 5/5Battery - 4/5Connectivity - 5/5Speaker - 4/5Processor Helio G90Tis much better than snapgragon , in fact due to powerful processor there is no lagging opening multiple Apps and camera also. Infact BT range is also extended than Redmi 8 or Redmi 7 pro. All Redmi phones are having heating issues and this also have, to some extent if you run heavy app. Front came is ok but rear camera is very good , even in low light environment in this budget. At least much better performance than Samsung M31. Battery is day long with moderate to heavy use with 4G on always.Overall very satisfied withing this budget, in fact better than Redmi 9 pro in terms of processor. One more thing in this budget no company is offering hands free Alexa build in which is a great feature .. Recently it got Android 10 and after that I am Loving it..",Partha Mohinta, 5 July 2020
257,Excellent smartphone!,5,"01-Hardware related highlighted feature!-Beautiful design with curved edges.-Screen to body ratio according to price is very impressive,bottom of the chin is very low.-Every hardware and sensors are present including (3.5 mm audio jack, IR blaster and big battery with fast charger out of the box.)-There is no major heating issue I face,0-40'C average temperature raised,if you play game in extreme setting otherwise normal temperature,but good things having liquid cooling technology.02-Camera related highlighted features!-Awesome camera quality both rear and front.-Portraits with professional-level bokeh,  Portrait mode with new Depth Control is also available on the TrueDepth camera for rear and selfies, you can control blur level in both real-time and after captured photos in any time.-64 MP camera are good but I think it need to improve because it wouldn't captures details like 64 MP, Macro-Shots are good.03- Software and Gaming experience!-Software is very smooth running on Android based MIUI 10.-High graphic games Pubg and Call of duty  in high setting HDR running very smoothly.03- Touch response is very fast.-Overall all king of mid-range smartphones!04-Cons-01- No OLED display,but IPS screen is very bright in sunlight.02- Raised camera bump so you need to buy a good case, that protect camera bump.",Amarnath Shah, 1 December 2019
258,6 months review,4,"Nice product, it doesn't lags still now works so smoothly but only issue i faced is it heats near camera while playing heavy games for few minutes. Thus it come back to normal, i guess that isn't a big issue so u can go for it. Battery backup is good but it takes almost 2 hours to charge completely. screen is also good it is easily visible under sunlight. But auto brightness doesn't work properly few times. Normally its ok for usage👍",Aswin Anand, 13 December 2020
259,Okayish mobile go for samsung m31 has better features in almost same price,3,After using it for approximately 2 monthsAll i can say is battery life is good goes well for 1½ day w/o chargingcamera is nice works well when clicking pictures outdoors of course that means macro shots come out pretty well but at but when the lights are quite them and when you take pictures in night inside your house they are comparatively not that great and when you open camera for recording video for photos at night u might see some granues dots flikering don't what it but i see itAlso the display is okayish picture quality and all (go for samsung m31 it's display is just wow😍 also better is almost every respect just 500 bucks difference)And even in the gallery when I view my pictures in the grid does vertical stripes appear but when when i open the picture  its clearI don't know what it is  but it bothers meAlso it heats up while charging like any other redmi phoneIt's heavy 200gm and big if you have tiny hand:POverall good but i felt like samsung m31 was good in the same price range with better features and the amoled display 😍 Choose wisely :),aboli, 24 August 2020
260,Is it worth,5,"It's one of the best phone around this range . Doesn't have the camera quality like realme XTBest for gaming Mediatech Helio processor just fantastic. Even though having a Liquid cooling system it have a bit heating issue but not overheating but compared to Pocco F1 it's a bit hot I'm a YouTube content creator. So i use all this phone. If having a bit more budget will suggest to go for Redmi K20 pro Realme X2. Or if looking for a gaming phone go for Asus Rog phone 2. Best tuung is that we are having a Hand free Alexa It's so nice that we can access Alexa by saying ""Alexa"" and Als use Google Assistant at the same time which is not available for any other phone of this range. The only Thing A back draw is its display and the water notch display. It's so tempting that it's just having a led IPS Display. By the way anything can't be perfect. Not that good as Pocco F1 if anyone using Pocco F1 better don't change it. Never go for phone saying 64 MP 108 MP etc because not just Megapixel which matter the picture quality. It has a great photo precision. If it found helpful please follow me and Click of the ""helpful"".",Mini, 5 December 2019
261,Great phone at this price tag.,4,"Although people are creating so much hype about Xiaomi being the best brand in providing great products at low cost, I assure you it is absolutely true.The Camera quality, picture clearity and steadiness in Note 8 Pro is astonishing.The design qality is great.Although, the 18W charger takes some time to charge the phone when you are playing games or using it continuously. But if you leave your phone  for some time you'll surely see the magic.Battery backup is enormus with 4500 mah massive battery.Best part is AI face unlock, finger print reader and night camera mode. They are all brilliantly integrated into this beautiful piece of work.",Anubhav Ingole, 27 May 2020
262,Overall good,4,Like,Amazon Customer, 2 December 2021
263,Performance beast not a camera beast,4,"The 64mp sensor is outstanding but the 16mp normal camera is over sharpening the image in some cases. Portrait mode is awesome but the dedicated night mode is an absolute failure too much noise. The normal mode works better than the night mode. Performance-wise its a beast with awesome battery backup. Normal use will last up to 3 days. For heavy use, it will last a full day. Gaming - no issues it can play almost every high-end games.  MediaTek Helio g90t - Absolute beast, no heating issues. The only problem I found with the Redmi note 8 pro is the imperfection in the image processing. I think this happens only with the Indian variant. It has great hardware. I am hoping that the image processing issues will be fixed with an update...And the gamma green is a very sexy color.",krishnajith, 12 December 2019
264,Very good camera and battery 🌟⭐🌌🏝️,5,I dont generally write reviews but after note 7 pro i wanted to buy something better than that. We all know that note 7 pro made a landmark name in this year for its camera performance but not 8 pro is few more steps ahead than that. There nis nothing that you can't do with this phone.1. All Modes tested on camera 5🌟2: you can use this phone in 50% battery for whole day trust me it's true so another 5🌟 for the battery performance(unlike samsung which starts giving issues with battery).3. I am not a gamer but whatever game i played on this phone i never phased lag or heating issues so Gaming is good too4. Display is better than Samsung. I have used Samsung sony iphone flagships but after a while all display fade away ans gives trouble to your eyes if you keep looking at them for  long time specially when a person like me who has migrane . I could use this phone without any eye strain etc. I loved the display.There are some issues as well.1. IT IS HEAVY AND BIG.2. NOT FOR SMALL HAND PEOPLE.3. HANDS GET TIRED.4. CAMERA BUMPER TOUCHES THE SURFACE.5. Takes time to charge. (because it has 4500mah battery),Rajiv kumar , 17 November 2019
265,Awesome value for money.,5,"one of the best mobile under this price. This phone is awesome. I have 5 start. to light weight, great feature, photo quality with ultra wide angel, micro & 64 megapixel is awesome. I so lucky I got this phone on First sale with 10% discount. After using more than 3 weeks, I didn't find any issue. Battery backup is awesome, I usually charge only one time in day. after heavy use of internet, gaming like PUBG, call of duty, videos and watching online movies, still Battery backup good. Liquid cooling technology is good, after playing PUBG continually more than 2 hours, mobile little bit heat. but just rest of 3 or  5 minute, mobile get cool. Overall this phone is awesome which give separate nano sim support means we can insert two sim in different slot.",Mohsin Bhatti, 6 November 2019
266,Definitely the best camera phone in the segment,5,"Things I love about it:The CAMERA IS REALLY CAPABLE, compared some shots with Galaxy S10e and my Reno 10x Zoom, I can tell in normal day light situations differences are minor, in low light condition it also does an excellent job, dynamic range is good but not great, macro images I have taken are amazing to look at, ultra-wide camera is okay. Considering the price it is really the best camera smartphone around 15k.Recorded Videos with main are also good, it has EIS which does a fine job of stabilizing.Reliable 2 day battery life for me as I don't play games too often.Mediatek G90T does a great job of handling day-to-day apps.Pubg mobile is running smooth with HDR+ultra frame rate.Things I like:Premium looking design, bought the Halo white color, gorilla glass on both sides.It is splash proof which is better than having no ingress protection at all, provides a little peace of mind.New HDR display which is bright enough.Dedicated microSD card slot.Things I don't like:Still no app drawer in the UI, lots of unnecessary apps, unwanted ads, confusing settings menu.While competitors have super Amoled it has an LCD screen.Faced a little bit heating while playing games, though it is not that much compared to previous phones.",Anindya Sundar, 11 November 2019
267,Satisfied by the Purchase.,4,"If you're looking out for a Budget phone,This phone is a great choice. If you're looking out for better performance in Pubg Mobile gameplay then go for it, Note 8 pro is far better than Redmi Note 9 pro in terms of gaming. You can google the comparison of Helio G90t and Snapdragon 730G.Charging Speed is pretty decent and battery backup too. with normal usage it lasts a whole day.Only cons I would consider that it's display is pretty average not so vibrant colours and sometimes MiUi behaves strangely.",Aadesh, 1 November 2020

273,Out of order within 6 months,4,This product I purchased in Nov-2019. Initially it was OK but after wards again and again rebooting was required. Once unfortunately it was got dropped in wet area and after some time stopped working and getting heated up. I contacted service centre on 25.05.20 for repair under warrant. I was told that there was moisture ingress and total expenditure will be approx Rs+9000 nine thousand and this is not covered in warranty. I told not to repair at this cost as  repair was approx 60% of the latest price. I really surprised why not covered under warranty..Any way I can say the sealing is not proper as moisture has intered inside....please suggest what to do....,rsyadava, 26 May 2020
274,4.5 out of 5 Go for it at 15000 budget,5,"Amazing phone at the budget of ₹15000Pros- You get a good battery backup of 24hour+ (if you don't play game and use mobile for normal usage and internet)- Phone does not lag while you play game- Superb Video quality- Design is very beautiful (gamma green)- Camera Quality is just wow with 64 mp camera plus you get lot of other camera features and good photo quality even in low light.- Finger print scanner response is very quick- Quick Charge- You can insert SD card as well as 2 sims- No heating problem felt even while playing game for an hourCons- Alexa does not respond quickly. Instead Google assistant is amazing- Screen size is big so using with one hand will be a problem- Phone is 200g so i will feel heavy if you hold the phone with one hand and watch video.- Low light and zoomed clicked photo is not good- Pre installed useless MI apps keeps poping up ads. Well you can disable that.Overall, I loved this phone at the price. Camera is amazing in day light.

Its been three days and it's working really good.I will give a detailed review of the phone after one month of usage.Note: The first delivered device had a quality issue. I've examined a light bleed on the LCD panel near the power button area, approximately 5mm from the edge of the screen. I didn't knew how that defect happened. Didn't observe it on the first day. There was no visible damage on the glass as well. I immediately ordered for a replacement and recieved it in good condition. I hope this time it will workout fine.",Krishna Teja, 21 July 2020

I see a lot of people complaining the same in their MI community however, not a single comment from Xiaomi regarding the update. I feel like I just downgraded myself from Realme 3 pro.2) Alexa doesnt work properly. Alexa is the main reason I bought this mobile.3) Ads in os (annoying).4) Charging takes longer time compared to VOOC chargers.5) Battery drains very fast eventhough it has big battery capacity 4300mah.6) Inbuilt steps counter should have been added as  Other mobile brands are providing them.

282,Best Smartphone under 20k,5,"I have been using this phone for past one year ,I will rate it out of 5 starAsthetics- 5Finger print sensor-5Gamming -5Mic quality -4.5Camera- 3.5Battery life -4.5These are my ratings ,other than this  there is no heating issue I had faced in it, while paying high graphics mobile gamming such as pubgy slight heat comes nearby camera region but its common for every phones so need not bother it.Its apperance and design is excellent ,no much  delay in fingerprint sensors, battery life good enough to use it for 24 hours,camera is better but if your a photo freak it's not so good. They are saying it is 64 mega pixel but I feel it same  as 16 mega pixel. Device works properly not hangging issues.",suresh, 9 October 2020
283,Good hardware- bad practical design,4,"A good phone with all bells n whistles. Things that I didn’t like and hence sold off1:Bulky phone- hard to hold and doesn’t fit in to jeans pockets2: heavy phone- it’s really a heavy phone at nearly 200 gm3: slippery back glass- though it looks good- it’s extremely slippery with glass back and big screen n higher weight4: battery life is okay for 1 to 1.5 days use5 car phone holders find it difficult to hold and it has fallen off the car phone holder in bumpy roadsBuy if you like to play games by holding in 2 hands.For office goers who need to check emails , respond to chat etc- this will not be liked by you.",Anil nanda, 3 March 2020
284,Over all a worthy buy,4,"I love the back cover, the color is nothing like I have ever seen. The build is a little heavy but feels sturdy, the camera is decent I will say. The phone comes with pre-installed apps from mi but that's the standard. Good performance, even with heavy usage and running multiple apps the phone doesn't hang and battery back up is fairly good. Charging speed is good too. Overall a worth buy, however do compare it with the newer models and other companies.",Arpan V., 24 November 2020
285,Read before buy....,4,Processor is pretty good but heating of the phone is on another level . I am writing this in winter think about in summer how much will it heat maybe they give an update or something so the heating got some less. Phone have no issue but camera quality is not that good. And in this price they must give ips display . But the display size is big and fully notch from corner to corner. Apps load very quickly. I have 8 gb and 4.8gb was always in used don't know why.? If you are buying for gaming its very good but in pubg sometimes it shut off immediately without any warning sign and that's sucks. Fingerprint is definitely fast and face id also.,sidhant verma, 14 February 2020
286,Ultimate Product from Mi,4,This is my first purchase from Brand MI.I can say i m very much surprised by the quality and each and every aspect.The best part is the price of the mobile and the specifications that are just unbelievable.I got this mobile during Diwali sale and got it delivered within 3 days after placing order.I bought Halo white 6 GB ram 128 GB storage variant.The color is very glossy and the finishing is very cool.The mobile is very slippery so you need to be extra careful while handling the phone.The only aspect is the camera lens design which is little bit out of the mobile shape which makes it very risky and fragile.Battery life is also great as 4500 mah battery runs all day long.Alexa builtin runs ok ok as per now.,Sanjay, 10 November 2019
287,Super Camera Beast -,5,Fantastic phone. Using it for past one & half month. No lag till date. Ultrafast fingerprint sensor. Rear Camera quality is good in natural light conditions. Front camera could have been better but OK in this budget. Battery life is sufficient for whole day on moderate use. I will recommend this phone as this is superbly priced as compare to other 64 MP budget smartphones. Gaming experience is superb while playing heavy games. Generates a little heat while playing games bt at acceptable level.  Pros:-1. Rear camera - 5/52. Front camera - 4/53. Fingerprint sensor - 5/54. Battery life - 4/55. Display - 5/56. Charging speed :- 5/57. Overall Design & looks :-8.  Cons:-1. A Little bit heavy & bulky device2. Ram management is not that great3. UI advertisements are irritating4. Hotspot connecting problem to the wifi adapter of my PC. Bt works fine when connects to any phone. Hope it will be resolved with software update.Overall a value for money camera beast smartphone. Recommend to buy 6/128 GB version.,Manish Jangid, 9 March 2020
288,All u need to know,5,"1 Display is awesome 5/5 with hdr support2 Camer:- rear- 5/5 , all camera except wide angle r awesome .  2mp macro lens is not sharp  Front- ok its good but does not provide much dynamic range . I mean many people will not find it but the one who r in camer can easily say itAlso it does not provide any decent level of beautification.it is very less and so some will like it and some may not. I personally wanted to have some good software beautify as now days there r good beautification for indian skin(it does not make u look koren but enhance the pic 😉)3 Processor :- its a beast at this price range even surpasses sd730g in pubg . Heavy gaming, editing u thow it all and it will prevail.(no over heating) GPU - it the same used in Samsung flagship but overclocked.4 battery its awesome 4500 mah and 18 watt fast charging is good .Till now using without tempered glass and no issue with the display gorilla glass 5 is awesome.(But has ordered a 6d 9h glass and people should use this instead of 11d)",Devansh, 29 December 2019
289,"nice product, battery is little bit concern , heating issue battery drain issue",3,"After a year I'm writing this review , very nice product, batter is little bit comcern , heating issue and battery drain issue with recent updates.",Anwesh, 7 January 2022
290,Amazing camera quality 🌸,5,"The best budget phone under 20k . Have been using this smart phone since a month now & I can't deny the fact that it has amazing camera quality . 64M.P is worth it at the price you are paying for this mobile , even the macro camera is so lit . The details of 64 M.P are so clear while zooming in, even if you click  at very low light places the results are just wooow !!  .Touch quality is so smooth . It has inbuilt Alexa which makes this device more special. You can ask alexa to play you songs , weather updates & what not.The dark mode which is  ' I'm fan of ' , is another amazing quality of this phone.  The HD quality of screen is another  amazing thing I loved about this mobile.The only drawback about this mobile is it's battery life which drains quickly but it can be managed by turning on battery saver.If I had to rate it overall , I'll rate it 9/10.",Shilpi, 15 March 2020
291,Smooth phone with some limitations,4,"Pros-  60 fps camera recording and  other camera effects similar to vlogging videos.  Box includes a back cover for protection as well.  MIUI10 installed in phone, has many features which other simple user interfaces dont provide.  Smooth phone when installed only 2-3 apps. Yet to check smoothness with multiple apps and huge data storage.Cons- Camera image little blurred even in 64 mp mode.  Battery life very bad. It went from 54% to 40 % in just half an hour of web browsing. Expeected its 4000 mah battery to be better than old gen 4000 mah batteries. In such pricy phone they should have included bigger battery like samsung m30s hai Suggestion to Xiaomi-  Please include tampered screen protector and tampered camera lens protector in the box.",Alok, 13 November 2019
292,Everything is best in this Phone,5,"I am using this Phone from a long time. Great camera, best display & very good battery backup. No lagging. Everything is very smooth. Best phone in this price range I can say even though the latest phone not able to beat this mobile.",Amandeep Singh, 8 December 2021
293,Awesome Product..,5,The Redmi Note 8 Pro design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.Phone got delivered at June 30 (I pre-order it on 28th June) I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast.Now I want to share my 1 month experience with Redmi Note 8 Pro.1) Battery backup is 48 hours as I used it for 1 week.2) Mind blowing Camera Quality and i am happy with camera quality.3) Display is more or less good.4) You will love the sound when your phone is ringing.5) Front camera is awesome and picture also comes very pretty.But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.,neeraj sharma, 10 August 2020
294,Below Average  😷😷,4,"Hello Everyone,I am using this note 8 Pro from past 25 days & would like to share with u my personal experience.Talking about processor, touch quality & finger print sensors i would say I m impressed without any lag touch screen smoothly working 😍😍 till last 1% of battery.But negative points are there too-While playing PUBG, game automatically gets shut 🤔even though M not that heavy user.While watching YouTube video gets pause automatically.Themes centre of Mi automatically sets to default theme and wallpaper after few moments of changing. And thats very irritating 😡😡 that might be Bug.",Anonymous, 5 July 2020
295,Alexa and Video call facility is not good.,5,"Everything is working fine## but Alexa is not responding and working fine. So many bugs are there. If you say Alexa, 3 to 4  times then it will respond. Sometimes if you say something to search then it won't follow it your command. I have a strong wifi connectivity and cellular data.##User interface is not good. Menu options is not present but Full screen function is too good and awesome. Battery backup and charging process is also too good. Sound quality is also fabulous.  No idea about camera. I didn't used properly. But it's ok. I clicked 3-4 pics and that will be fine.Note# in built video calling is also not working fine. Everytime it's showing error like called user is not supporting video call facility even that he is also using Redmi note 7 pro. I don't know why they are not analysis this issues before published in market.😏😏😏😏😏",Nilesh Kumar singh, 27 June 2020
296,Good for price,4,"After using 2 weeks i would like to place a review. This redmi note 8 pro is one of the best you could find in the price range, especially with the processor. Playing online game or any other big game, you wont feel any lag.  The pro with liquid cooling technology also play a great role.Camera: dont expect to be a DSLR camera, for a phone camera it really work perfect. Its battery little drain fast campare to that of samsung m30 i.e 6K mAh, but the fast charging is ok. If anyone tying to buy a phone of mid-range u should go for it. Its a reasonably price. But, Redmi should improve its display like Samsung AMOLED.",Samuel l., 5 March 2020
297,Worth the money,5,"Using Note 8 Pro gamma green 6/128 gb version since 2 weeks.Build quality is solid and design is premium.Finger print reader is fast and can unlock with wet fingers also.HDR display is good and brightness is very good to be visible in sunlight. Although Amoled would have been excellent.Mediatek Helio G90T is excellent. I have played COD at highest settings without any stutter. No heating issues faced till now.Battery backup is good, it will last more than one day. At the end of the day my battery remains about 20-25%. Screen on time is around 7 hours. Although Alexa app is draining battery and needs to be fixed with updates. Charging time is around 2 hours.Quad camera setup is good. Night mode is very good and 64 mp images are also very good. Front camera is also good.Miui 11 is very smooth and UI is very good.Overall it's very good phone and worthy. If you are strict on budget and can live with HDR IPS panel and charging time of 2 hours then it's not bad when compared to Realme X2.",Yash Aryan, 30 December 2019

301,Redmi is ok Amazon is a lootera,4,"Cost me extra but product is goodBefore lockdown 20 Amazon was my daily choice but since April 20 Amazon changed their policy and became the online lootera, they don't have any ethic values for Indian people",Sagar singh, 1 June 2021
302,Perfect budget phone.,4,"I am writing this review after so long, have been using this phone since 2 years and i never felt ug lags or has any issues, though i dont play games like pubg and all. But apart from that phone was pretty good to use.",Saqib qadri, 1 May 2021
303,4 star,4,Overall phone is good. 5 *Camera - all the four lenses give a great shot for the respective purpose.However the night mode is not so good.Also the front camera gives blur photo when taken in low light.The performance is like charm.It gets heat up when i play PUBG on it. Not much but a little. And no lag at all if you are connected to a good internet connection.On normal usage the battery drains faster even if I am connected to Wifi.It could be due to the network as well.Touch and display is like butter.Overall i will rate it 4.I hope Mi can improve the battery performance by optimising the core performance of the hardware..,Ashish, 20 December 2019
304,Go for it,5,Excellent phone.. Works as smooth as a butter... No glitch or lag.. Purchased it on 4 june and got it in just 2 days.. Thank you Amazon. .. Finger print reader is very quick and battery lasts for almost 2 days after playing games like pubg for 2 to 3 hours.... Intitally was a bit disappointed because of the LCD Ips display.. I was using amoled previously but it's fine.. Once u use it u dont feel that much difference... Plus u get helio g90t processor which makes game play super smooth and liquid cooling tech which is mostly availble on flagship phones...If ure having confusion over M31... I'd say go for this if ure a heavy game user but if enjoy watching movies and you tube vids on a good screen then buy the m31 ...so overall this a great product at 13499...i got 1000 off on hdfc card due to an offer,Emmanuel, 15 June 2020
305,Absolutely Worth It,5,"Everything is great as expected from this phone except for the ads that are shown up in these redmi smartphones and few bloatwares, if you are ready to compromise with ads and pre-installed useless applications, then go ahead and make the purchase cause this is the most value for money product. I have a friend who have Redmi K20 Pro, he suddenly came up to me so that he can show off to me his overpriced smartphone and this Redmi note 8 pro beat his one with a great distance, he tried to show off from his camera and Note 8 Pro's camera quality knocked him off and he was like, I paid so much money for this premium device and it got beaten up by this midrange smartphone what a fool I was to spend such amount of money on K20 Pro. And I was like ""I feel proud of you my Note 8 Pro"". 😊😂",Sourav Das, 25 May 2020
306,Almost!!!!!! The perfect Mid Ranger. GO FOR IT 👍,4,Initial review1. Camera 4/5 great in daylight struggle in low light2. Battery : 5/5 More than expected with fast charging support3. Performance : 5/5 No need to say anything it's absolutely a beast.(For the people boasting about heating issue if you are general user to a moderate gamer there is no heating issue at all)4. Fingerprint and face unlock : 5/55.Pricing : Got a great exchange value plus 1000 price cut plus 10% bank offer 😀6. UI: MIUI is great except those ads but obviously u can disable it. although bloatware bothers me7. Ram management : 4/5 could have been better8. Value for money : 5/5Overall : 4.7/5.0,AVI, 19 January 2020
307,"Great battery, great for social networking websites, cameras can be better",4,"I bought my redmi notepro in mid December and I love the speed and it's usability, it's battery life does last quite long like I am always on Twitter, tiktok or fb and it lasts more than a day easily with the GPS on. The camera I was very excited about but a) it automatically beautifies and in app cameras don't click good pics, usually my WhatsApp pictures are pixelated like there's smudge on the camera. The finger print sensor is nice and easy to configure. I do not play any games which I understand is a crime with a powerful phone like this. Furthermore, you only get SD quality videos on Netflix and other platforms but otherwise, the display is no less than AMOLED",Atraya mukherjee, 15 January 2020
308,Very fair product with its prices,4,Redmi products are always decent to use specially when it compared to another brands and price. Camera quality outside is excellent but not in low light conditions. Battery is as usual decent. Display quality is also satisfied. Finger print sensor having no complaints. Face lock also very good. Playing PubG is not an excellent experience but not bad though. I suggest all Redmi products when their model becomes old coz in new model there is not much difference but Redmi reducess it's old old prices on a big scale. You can't match any other price with that after reducing prices.,Amazon Customer, 21 June 2020
309,Stunning and shinny !!!!,4,"Well phone looks amazing on the outside as well as on the inside their are many unbelievable things. 64mp camera with AI . I don't find much difference in camera quality but software and buttons are different though. Alexa is what I like but have to configure it . Busy with phone configuration....will write more after further use.Now it's 8 months now the phone is working great . Played all the heavy games like pubg and other. Performance wise it's great. But little disappont ment with the camera picture quality although the phone is having 64 megapixel but picture looks very unnatural. Like some extra work is done after the picture clicked by its AI.Performance is goodCamera is also goodGraphics also greatPhone cover turns yellow , after a while.",neeraj verma, 12 November 2019
310,VALUE FOR MONEY,5,"I've been using this mobile for over 7 months now and I'm pretty satisfied with the performance. The processor is quite smooth and can run heavy games and applications without lag. The camera quality is also up to the mark. About the battery backup, it'll run whole day long if you're a heavy user, and if you're not a heavy user, then the battery life can last up to 2 days. The only complaint that I have is that there are slight heating issues while charging, running heavy games, or after using it continuously for a prolonged period of time. As an overall, it is worth the money and a good mid-range smartphone.",Tamojit Ghosh, 17 January 2021
311,Poor sound- every else is great,3,"It all depends which phone you have used before buying this one. Not a premium mobile phone it's just realme 1. Major major drawback is audio is worst. Speaker is not good to ring in out station like when you are driving, or in the traffic, kept in pocket. Those who says sound is good are deaf or senseless listeners in point of music and sound quality. All Redmi phones are not giving us natural sound or quality sound. It gives the sound output that will be good only for cheap earphones (100rs ). I am music lover, used lenova, realme, swipe, Nokia, all mobiles sound was great means they don't ehnance the default sound output into bass enabled mode, But Redmi does it. I have changed all settings Equalizer, headphone type, changed 320kbps songs also but I didnot get what I wanted. You won't hear the isolated part of different instruments or music and voice even. Except sound this is best mobile, but sound matters me a lot. Over night I cloned my old (realme) phone to note 8 pro. And today I went outside and riding bike and walking in the street, believe me I kept full volume and vibrate. I received 9 missed calls in different times but I could not sense it because of the inadequate loudness. You don't go with this only if you are a music lover.

312,Powerful performance. Great looks and value.,5,"A beautiful phone. Halo White looks exquisite.I was torn between Samsung M30 S which was cheaper for Great Indian sale and Realme X2 on Flipkart. But Redmi note 8 pro had more good reviews. Got 10 % discount with credit card for 6gb ram / 128 gb storage.  Samsung has a plastic body vs. Redmi's gorilla glass front and back which looks premium, which was a deciding factor for me.Camera also is better than Samsung. Has a good battery and 18 w fast charger. Display is vibrant. Touch and finger print scanner is quick without lags.Finger print scanner is right below the camera lens on the back so your finger smudges lens if you are not used to it, if you have used front finger print scanner.Not a big fan of MiUI coming from pure Android. Disabled all ads and bloatware before first use. MiUI has dark mode which is good.This is a powerful phone performance wise.Only complaint is the ringtone volume is not very loud.Phone is a bit heavy but the battery is of higher capacity.",Dr. C. S Babu, 24 January 2020
313,I like the package,4,Good quality,girisha, 20 November 2021
314,Best Smartphone under 20K.,4,"The build is premium and sturdy. Features are good but is loaded with too many bloatware though which can be disabled through android debug bridge (ADB) commands  using a computer and necessary software needed to do so.Processor performance is good, display quality is good along with touchscreen  responsiveness. Fingerprint sensor is also good but didn't like its placement withing the camera module because of which most of the time I end up touching the camera lenses instead of the fingerprint sensor.",Sunil Subba, 7 October 2020
315,Great Hardware with some cons,5,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 The phone is really good for the price point. I've been using it for little over a week and I've mixed thoughts.Lets start with pros and cons of this phone..Pros:Good IPS DisplayGreat battery life and fast enough charging speedsGreat design and buildType-CIR Blaster.Cons:MiUIMiUIMiUIMiUIAnd everything else is nitpicking..My biggest complaint is the MiUI. Not that it is a slow skin, but there are ads in system apps, there is a lot of bloatware (fortunately uninstallable) and various other aspects of it..Camera is good. Takes good photos with all cameras in daylight and struggles a bit in low light.Selfie camera is also good if you are ok with some skin smoothening and such.Battery performance is great and does last more than a day. Charging speed is fast enough to fill 0% to 100% in 1.5 hrs.Fast and accurate fingerprint scanner.IR Blaster is actually good and useful.I'll be updating the review as I continue using this phone..I'm attaching a video and some photos with this review (photos are not edited), you can also find me on YouTube @TechniKally..:)",Robin, 26 January 2020

So Personally after usage of 3 days i am Satisfied For Gaming , streaming videos,Its  Monster.About The Fingerprint Scanner Its Awesome and Fastly recognizes About The camera section good. Coming to the battery section 4500mah battery Here we can watch 4 to 5 movies of 2hours and gaming we can continuously play for 5 to 6 hours continously and also has a great standby .The only thing i wasdisappointed was the transparent case which was included in the box was not protected for Camera hump and also there was no headset so that was a bit disappointment. So Go for it.",Saif A., 18 November 2019
318,Redmi note 8 pro My Honest User Experience,5,"The best part of this product is that it was ddelivered to me on the day of Diwali. And made my day special thanks Amazon for that.Display - Perfectly bright display ,good colours ,great screen size no any complaints regarding the display here . However if you a amoled display only go for that but this is no less than that .Battery- Just one word Monster . Great capacity.Build quality - Nice look and feel ,better design but this set will quite heavy if yours hands are smaller . I have no issues in this section .Camera - Overall a good package camera ,youncan get some nice shots with all the cameras, however it lags in some low light shot but manages to keep pics less noisy and good. Both the front and back cameras are awesome .The AI here works too good .Sound - Sound section I can say it's average in noisy areas . But great in indoor .The headphones output is just awesome .Connectivity ,sensors all things work well .Well optimised UI i.e., MIUI.Overall it's a nice and good packege Xiaomi is offering .You should just go for it . 👍",Rajat Pandey, 7 November 2019
319,Loved the Device.,5,"Best mobile...I have got this top variant 6/128 at 14000 after exchanging my old phone K8 NOTE.Im really impressed by the camera, display and touch responsiveness..But i am still shocked that im using it since last 5 days but i haven't seen any adds from mi ui its really buttery smooth. Battry charges really fast and lasts about 2 days... I dont play heavy games in it . I use it for social media platform and video editing purpose. Overall this device have no issues regarding the graphics performance and the gpu which is similar to the flagship galaxy note 10 series.There's zero heating issues till now, mi iu 11 is running in it . I would recommend this device every time when i will be asked about any allrounder phone under 15K. Thanks for reading.",rahul, 3 August 2020

321,It's a good phone,4,"I bought this phone on a very short notice.Thanks to amazon for delivering it pretty quick.coming to the phone.The build, design and the speed is good.The camera despite the 64 MP tag is average.It comes with a lot of bloatware which one can remove to a good extent.The charging is slow. Took almost 2 hours to go from 0 to 100.Acceptable since the battery is big.Try using POCO launcher to give it a good look.Phone operates really well in dark mode.Overall rating- 3.5/5",adityam, 14 June 2020
322,Solid overall package in the budget,4,I am quite happy with it. Overall it's a good and recommended product. Battery backup and charging speed could have been better as compared to competition.  higher battery capacity is compansating  the power hungry mediatec processor.Not sure if performance and battery backup remain same or become worst going by the time considering the Mediatec history.Camera is good. Night mode photography can be improved.Finger print speed is super fast.HDR Display is good. L1 support is there but Netflix and Amazon videos are not playing in HD.Overall day to day performer is very good. Not facing any lag issue.There are some software bugs here and there. Needs to be fix in coming software update.,Prabhu Keshari, 18 December 2019
323,"Disappointed - Bad phone, Bad Camera",2,I had an Asus selfie which was like 4 yrs old in a time when people chancge phone every year. The Asus had a good built inspite of dropping it multiple times. It had a good camera but low light pics would pixelate. I wanted an upgrade in the camera n hence opted for this phone.The Redmi note 8 pro for 16k is not worth the camera for sure. The other features are good n serves the purpose. I would suggest to explore other options. This was my 1st MI buy n a big mistake.Camera - It boasts of a quad camera but reality it's no where upto mark. In Selfie mode it doesn't offer same features. In low light the pics are bad and pixelate. The 64 Mp camera is slightly better but when blown up it pixelates. It's got a Samsung lens not sure if that's the reason. My previous Asus had better features. My friend had a Vivo with better light in low light mode.Battery Life - the batter for now seems good. In 1 charge it works the whole day almost 8-10 hrs which is impressive @ 4500 mah .Processor - it's got a media tek processor which is fast n smooth. I did like it compared to my previous phone. Im not into gaming so couldn't evaluate this better.Design - the design is fine although the camera bulges out from the back. As the phone came with a cover it solved the purpose. The phone comes with a Gorilla glass which is good.Storage - the storage is good at 128 GB and also has space for a memory card. That's helpful.App - it has a lot of inbluilt apps which may not be necessary and useful.I've compared this phone to Samsung M30s but that was similar so opted for this.,Franc , 26 November 2019
324,Simply good comfort to use,4,"In starting this mobile takle 10-15% in 1 hour starting i think i will replace it but after my friend sujestion i will drained the battery then charge more than 6 hour it will proper workIt has take nearly 10% in internet useAbove or near 5 % in normal useIts very nice in gamingBut it cooling liquid can't work properly in sometime over usage it will has hotAnd another drawback is it comparitively my sujestion more weightThen camera condition is good ,and it snap time is fastAnd it has friendly in usage it has stand in 1 day in normal usage",karthickeyan, 4 March 2020
325,It's a masterpiece for this price 👌👍,5,"First look: The phone handles like a beauty• Didnt have any ads Poppin up like all the reviews given in the net• Although thre were some apps installed without my permission• The main camera is good but the front camera is just trash, but can be made better using some camera apps• Installing the poco launcher is really helpful because people who were using phones from other brands also might get a similar interface•Im one of the first people to buy the electric blue colour, it does give a rather eye-catching touch but might feel a little too shiny for regular useReview after 3 weeks of use• The phone still handles like a beauty• I've tried a few games and all in high settings and they worked wonderfully• Didn't really experience any heating issues too• The battery is  amazing. U can use it with ease for 2 days• The main camera after comparing with many of the new phones released recently have given this phone the throne for one of the best smartphone camera's there is in a midrange product",jacob mathew, 30 November 2019

Perfect.,5,"The Review is after 3 Month -Pros -1.Good Battery Life2.Camera are well in the league of Flagships.Those who are commenting that Camera is bad, don't know how to use it. Colour reproduction is good. Macro gets it job done. And Highlight is 64 MP. Details are clear.3. MIUI11 is Fluid & Best if You know how to disable ads.4. Display isn't AMOLED, But it is surely in Higher League than average LCD Panels.5. Good Edge Detection in Both Front & Back Cameras.6. Excellent Processor - Helio G90T. Played PuBG, CoD, and Mortal Kombat at once & It handled beautifully.Cons -1. Charging Speed isn't that much great. But first 60% are fast enough to power you for a day.2. Alexa isn't much responsive & little buggy. Can be updated by SW Update.3. If using without a cover, Slippery body & Camera Bump may be at disadvantage.4. RAM Management is 50-50.5. Slow Motion camera flickers in Low Lighting.Will add a Long Term review also :)",Anurag Ghuge, 27 January 2020
327,Best phone,5,Besttttt,Rishav b., 16 March 2022
328,worth every penny,5,"Just wow!!i received the package in 3 days of ordering.. Very well packed,, thanks to the courier partner..Now coming to the specs of the phone.. The phone is just awesome & it goves brilliant outcomes.. The camera is fantastic, just wow... I just loved it.. I was lucky enough to get an 8 gb+ 128 gb variant by exchanging my redmi note 6 pro & paying more 12.4k.. The processor is on another level.. No wonder redmi gives a tough competition to any other smartphones in todays market.. I play high end games at high graphics & frame rate is just awesome.. I get 60 fps at highest speed anyone could ever imagine..the best smartphone in the market.The camera has too many modes including portrait,,panorama, night mode & pro modes respectively.. The video also got some cool features such as slow motion,, super slow motion & short videos.. But you cannot expect video cordings at higher frame rates & also it applies to the slow & super slow motion..All in all a great smartphone for gaming, camera & processor.. Thanks amazon",Deeptiman Dwibedy, 7 January 2020
329,Too much hang and automatic switch off and Screen blur...,3,Not good....Too much hang and automatic switch off and Screen blu ..like damage screen.,Mujeeb Shaik., 6 February 2022
330,Paisa wasool,4,"Probably this is the most beautiful looking phone in this price range, no other brand is even close. But, it has few drawbacks of it's own, battery life being one of them. You expect at least a day and half with 4500 mAh pack,but lasts just one day at most.  Some pre-installed apps can not be removed and that's a bummer. Finger print is fast and accurate, no complaints in that department. Camera is good, not exceptional, but again for the asking price it's better than the competitors. It has some water resistant rating, which is very thoughtful from Redmi, couldn't have asked for more.All in all satisfied with the look and performance.",Amzad Ansari, 22 January 2020
331,Best in segment for sure,4,No doubt its been honoured with a ton of awards. No doubt its best in segment for now keeping in mind the price. The camera is really worth mentioning and details are really sharp and clear when vompared to other ones but the image processing and the colors could have been better. The battery life is good and gives me easily a day's backup keeping in mind that I am a hardcore user. The fingerprint sensor also does a preety good job and is surely fast. You can go with this and definitely this wont disappoint you. And i have given few shot examples and few of them can be used as wallpaper also!!,Veena, 27 January 2020
332,WHAT A BEAUTY!💯❤️,5,"Do, Day 3 with this beast and honestly, this is the absolute best under 20k, in my opinion. The picture quality, the camera, the design, the build, the performance, the battery, everything is just way too good to be true!Although I haven't started gaming on this beast yet as it is so new and I don't wanna put any kinda pressure on the processor, I can tell you that the G90T is the absolute best and can easily handle anything you throw at it so don't worry about that!The overall smoothness of the device is just so good! The in-hand feel with the glass back is so premium, it feels like a device priced at way beyond 17k.To sum it up, the Redmi Note 8 Pro is worth all your penny!💯💯❤️❤️",Sagnik Das Gupta, 23 July 2020
333,Redmi note 8 pro,4,Nice mobile phone for this price... Good camera quality fast fingerprint and face unlock...we can charge fully within 1 hr and 45 minuts (i charged 50% in just 30 minuts) and battery draining is normal like other phones... It doesnt have amoled display but it have good display quality... Awsome gaming experience...no lag and normal heating while gaming but not a big issue...it comes with android 9 and i got android 10 when i updated... I sure this is the king in 15000-18000 price range...,ameen p., 10 July 2020
334,Note8Pro review after 1 month of usage,4,"I have used this phone for almost a month now.This is good phone, few pros and cons as belowPros:1. Good in display2. Touch response is awesome3. Batter life for normal phone usage along with bit of browsing and 30 min to 1 hr video is fetching 1 complete day. Earlier I was getting 1.5 days4. Camera looks pretty good. I am still yet to explore the available optionsCons1. Battery life slowly getting reduced, which is worrying point2. Sometimes screen gets into landscape mode (now it is) and gets back to portrait mode only when phone is restarted",Vinay V Uttarkar, 9 March 2020
335,TECHNOLOGY AT AFFORDABLE COST,5,"First of all, it's the best budget phone under 15k. To be frank redmi is the phone known for ""TECHNOLOGY AT AFFORDABLE COST"".Pros:1)The phone's performance is top notch2) The camera is considerably good. You can't expect much of pro pics even though they mention it as 64mp .3) The design is Ultimate. It's like competing with One plus 7 pro. It's resemble merely like a premium brand phones. The electric Blue is lit.4) Overall the phone is best for it's speedy and glassy and classy performance.Cons :1) If you're considering this phone for your privacy and banking purpose it is not at all advisable. There are a lot of advertisement and access to third parties. It is merely easily accessible by any third parties which envisages them to pop advertisement for us.2) The screen quality is OK as it is LCD. Now it's the era a of AMOLED displays.3) Heating is considerably fine .4) Prone for camera scratch so use a good back cover .",Hari, 2 December 2019
336,Good job... Blindly go for it,4,Really Beast phone by Mi in this compromising price.....,Jay S., 21 October 2021
337,Awesome buy. Camera quality superb,4,Redmi note 8 pro is my best purchase so far.  This fits your budget and it's battery life and camera quality is awesome.. So if ur looking for good camera quality I suggest u go for it.The only cons I can say is when phone is in loudspeaker the vibration can be felt on ur hands.. I am sure if it is with my phone Or with model..Other than that this phone is simply superb n worth your money.,Sahana Puthran, 6 August 2020
338,Best Midrange smartphone for gaming,5,"Performance :- When it comes to performance with G90T they just killer every mid range phone in terms of performance it's better then Snapdragon 712,730 and equal or better then 730G.When I play pubg in HDR ULTRA I realise I have made the best decision  CAMERA:- The quality and clearity of its camera is awesome, In day light it capture every detail (Har deetail note kiya jaye ) But XT performances better their but In low light condition Clearly Note 8 Pro is winner and the macro camera just zoom till 2cm and the picture  comes with great details and looks awesome.  BATTERY:- 4500 MAH battery works definately great but an IPS LCD pannel don't save battery  BUILD QUALITY :- It comes with glass body which feel premium in hands and looks beautiful It is one of the best phone in mid range segment in build quality  CONS:- 1) Consume more power during playing games because the processor is build in 12nm technology  2)They should provide Super amoled in this price range.",Rahul, 24 December 2019
339,The most powerfull mobile in good price range,4,"This device comes in normal xiaomi packaging.I used this product from last 7 daysBelow is reveiw-1-Display is top notch, as usual good display.2-Back cover is laminated with gorilla Glass 5 which is a premium finish3-Speaker is good not more that Redmi Note 5 Pro but okay4-Performance awsome..No even hang single time from last week5-Camera us very nice specialy night mode is supereb as compair other mobile in same price range6-Battery life is too good7-Screen size is bigger but mobile size is same as redmi note 5 proAdd On -1-Alexa app is some attractive future...2-Device seems heavier but without cover is ok4-A lit bit of heating issues but average",Sudhir Yadav (NBD), 20 November 2019

341,Redmi Note 8 pro Week Review,4,"Starting with the delivery thing.I received this product on the third day since I ordered.Really fast delivery server and the product was also in good condition maybe depending on the location.I live in North Delhi.This is a good product, good value for money product.You can customize anything on the phone like- fonts, icons, it also has a cool dark more.Performing wise this phone is really performing well.But there are some heating issues but not too much..All together it can satisfy your regular needs.After a week phone is maintaining it's accuracy and performance level.",Arpan, 24 February 2020
342,Review after 2 months use.,4,"Performance is excellent. Touch and fingerprint sensor is also up to the mark. Sound quality is good. Camera quality is not at all to the mark as presented by company. The pics are blur and it is not acceptable when you have a so called 64 MP camera.Vidoes are much better than photos. Also slow motion feature is great.Overall it is a great phone, but purchasing 8GB ram varient is not required. J have 8GB ram varient and so I felt that there is no such difference in performance as compared to a 6GB ram varient.",Chetan choudhary, 7 March 2020
343,Overall happy but...,4,"####Review after usage of 12 daysDespite 6GB, it lags quite frequently when I want to return to home screen.Google voice search will starts even when phone is idle.####Review after 3 days of purchase.Well I am not very impressed. I were using NOTE4 before I bought Note 8 Pro 6 GB/64GB variant.Long size screen is somewhat troublesome when operating with one hand.Many a time there is lag when coming back to home screen from any other applicable or other screens though not too often but there is.Whenever there is a white background, BACK button goes invisible.But I am happy as those are very small things.",Vaibhav, 22 December 2019
344,Worth buying,4,"Finger print sensor doesn't work properly after few months usage. Touch screen issues while Playing pubg, can be resolved by removing three fingers screen shot option and other sensitivity options in game booster. FPS for pubg is not as expected these are tho only complaints. But good phone for the price range I bought at Rs14500 6GB 128 GB using all offers. No heating issue at all I mentioned only cons everything else are pros in this phone.",Mallesh Dharmaraj, 1 September 2020
345,Very Good,5,,Dakkhancha Raja Services, 9 March 2022
346,Good for the price with some short comings.,3,"Ordered this during lockdown for my mom, phones price were increased a lot during the time. But you cant go wrong with the product. Have been using Redmi phones for a long time now and the offer good quality for the price.Pros:-- Good camera.- Good processing power can handle most games like pubg and all.- Good sound quality note it has a single speaker.- 6GB ram makes it future proof, for atleast next 3 years, as we know the bloatware in android.Cons:--Sadly it does not have Amoled screen wished it could have but again the price so not complaining.-One thing i noticed is network quality is always a con on redmi phones, it gives a headackhe after long calls not sure what might be the cause, tried the same sim in realme x2, iphone XR, even iphone SE didn't face the issue.-Also please note the screen quality is not that good. Its okay for daily usage but viewing angles are not that great.- Ads and inbuilt bloatware on redmi phones is annoying.",harshal pandit, 27 August 2020

348,Overall beats urs aspectation,4,"I am a total hardcore mobile user and for me performance matters and battery life too on a daily bases. And for sure performances stands out and battery life is a decent too,if I charge my phone 100 from morning I have too charge it in later half of the day once to complete my day.Camera is  a kind of brilliance for me and ram management is quiet decent.Build is superb too. But after using it for 3 months in pubg sometimes the game freezes and the game need to be restarted it happened for 6 times till the date of purchase.",Dhanesh dash, 6 March 2020
349,RN8 PRO or Other Phone?,5,"If your budget is under 20k or 15k. Go for it! More down. ^_^*Display is good for the price. FHD+ HDR.*Design is awesome. Halo White is mine.It's curved at the back making it easy to hold. Gorilla Glass 5 BACK tho.*MediaTek G90T works well, hardly any heating issues. Sometimes you can use it as your PRESS. But lot of sunlight required.*Battery is awesome(4500Mah) you get 18W charger, in the box itself which charges the phone in 2hours.*Camera is wonderful except...64MP works well, 10X zoom, Night mode, Macro Lens, is okay. But Wide angle sucks a bit as the image colour gets poorer.The Fifth camera works well too.Selfie!!! Obviously. Good for pouts ladies😙ALEXA is okay okay. Prefer Google assistant as default and Add ALEXA too.Now comparison with Realme XT.If you really need indisplay Finger Print Scanner and AMOLED display.Prefer Realme XTOr if back scanner and HDR FHD+ display okay. Go for Redmi Note 8 Pro as it is better in camera and processor.Thank you, Hope this helps.(MIUI 11 is in December)",Veena rani, 8 November 2019
350,Mi is best,5,"It's really a great phone. I don't know why people are bothered about the heat issue. I have always used Mi phones and never experienced abnormal heat issues. I mean if u use excessive gaming while charging on a hot day what do you expect?I have recommended note 8 pro to my friends and family. They really liked the electric blue colour and have purchased the same. 🤗Battery life and other specifications are good. I personally like the inbuilt online music app, mi cloud services, and the range of themes. My partner and I bought note 8 pro and Samsung galaxy A80 (rs 49000) for him at the same time. And his phone's condition is 😆 now.",Ayeshah, 23 September 2020
351,Good option to buy Redmi note 8 pro for this price,4,"Pros1. Inbuilt Amazon Alexa2. Turbo gaming option3. Lot of inbuilt applications like wps office, cleaner, screen recorder etc4. Option to remove google advertisement5. Screen clarity, resolution6. Option to clone appsCons1. Battery, to recharge everyday2. Heating the mobile while playing Pubg3. Struck the mobile sometimes while playing pubg mobile liye4. Mobile is too smooth, chance to slip from hands5  camera lens are need to protect by pouch otherwise it may got damage",kambham srinivasulu, 17 July 2020
352,Overall Good Power Phone.,4,"Overall good budget phone with lots of power and features. Camera App is good, Battery backup good too. Fast Charger is working great. Specifically liked the Calender App with integrated Panchang and other stuffs. Not sure if that Calender app is available in other Android Mobiles and iPhones.Found one serious issue after the latest update to MIUI 11 where Incoming SMS causes the audio to disappear, for a while, during an ongoing call. Not sure if Mi is going to release any Fix.Edit: 05-MarAfter using these many days I feel it is a bit heavy to the hand and pocket.",Prabhat, 10 February 2020
353,Redmi Note 8 Pro (worth for what you paid),5,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 I got it in first sale and delivered next, delivery was very fast, so been using this phone for 15 days now.Tempered glass, surely there is a new thing called unbreakable glass which actually breaks lol.So don't go for online but it from local store something and try Samsung M30s tempered glass company Pinglo its cheap fits good instead of redmi note 8 pro one.Review(Updating soon more)Yea phone looks amazing and have really good looks.Its bit too heavy to hold sometimes with one hand.1st week phone might get heated but then everything was gone liquid cooling actually working maybe need time to settle down first time.Doing some geat testing will update you with results.Performance : Ram management is really good and smooth. Very responsive.Gaming : So i put settings on smooth+ Extreme on PUBG Mobile and also HDR+ULTRA best part with gaming screen recording on FHD still gameplay was smooth and i got average frame rate of 39 and 40 with recording ON an without that it obviously goes higher.Slow motion works good, but i can't expect it to be very good at this price range.Macro is doing great job just it need more light ans sometimes using flash ruins it. I have uploaded some samples.",Anshul Gumber, 6 November 2019

355,All Time Best Mobile Phone With All in One,5,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Anyways, the Redmi Note 8 Pro is quite comfortable to hold and operate and looks quite premium for its price. The bezels around the display (and even at the bottom) are extremely narrow and the selfie camera is housed within a v-shaped notch.The quad-camera module on the back juts out quite a bit and there’s a capacitive fingerprint sensor that you can easily pass off as the fourth camera sensor from a distance. This elevated camera system isn’t prone to scratches (so far) but accumulates too much dirt and grime around the edges.More than used 1 month ago Great experience with Redmi Note 8 pro 8gb 128gb BlackProsRobust design with dual Gorilla Glass 5 panels.Bright LCD panel.The brand new MediaTek Helio G90T is snappy and efficient at the same time.Outstanding battery life.The main 64MP sensor is versatile and delivers excellent images at day and night.The selfie camera is also pretty good.Great video recording quality overall.Supports USB PD charging, comes with USB-C to USB-C cable and appropriate charger in the box.ConsThe macro and ultrawide cameras are uninspiring to say the least.Video recording in 1080p leaves more to be desired.No selfie via FingerprintNo MIUI Always on Display",Imilyasgns, 3 December 2019

362,Look for better options.,5,"I find the phone great...It's heavy compared to other cell phones (200 gms)I must says it's better than One Plus Series considering the functions & the price.The Night Camera is useless, but the 64 mp is great.Charging is excellent, no need to buy any additional charger 18 w is great.Video recording, Onscreen recording & Call Recording is excellent.MI interface is very smooth & easy for non MI users like me.Sound could have been bit louder, but I still love my Halo White phone.Functioning is very very smooth & it's a pleasure using it. Worth every penny of my hard earned money. I also got a discount of 1800 Rs using the Axis Bank Card.My Review after using for 2 months -Too too heavy.Too long cannot use by single hand.Heating issues during recording & also during charging.Camera is really useless.Takes too long to charge.Personally I am fed up with its weight & switching to my One Plus.",Imperial, 7 November 2019
363,Decent phone in under 16k,4,I have been using the phone for 3 days now.The phone almost delivers on almost everything it says it does.I haven't faced any heating problem which I was worried about with mediatek SoC.Cons:- The facial recognition is worst I have seen. Anyone and anything can unlock the phone.- The camera bump on back is big and spoils the back design- The camera doesn't deliver on 64MP but it's not bad when compared to an avg 48MP camera- The side frame of the phone looks cheap compared to premium finish on back and front- Fast charging is not that fast and takes about 2 hours for full charge,Shankey Poddar, 16 November 2019

Battery drops around from 3-5 overnight.(I dont know if it is a problem)4. No heating issues while gaming until now......(Tested for 1.40 hours along with a mobile case.I dont feel any heat.)5.charge dropped from almost 11% after playing for 1.40 hours (100 to 89).These are what i noticed until now....will update with more infos.,Akhil , 13 December 2019

It was very good experience shopping with you'll. Wanted to give this phone has a Christmas gift to my mom. I could give this gift to my mom exactly on 25th December is only because of your quick service.Now, lets talk about the performance of this phone1) Processor: Very good and no lagging.2) Camera : Don't known about others, but in my case I am happy with its pic quality. The only drawback is that it has a protruding surface on the back of the phone. So whenever you keep there are chances that you are keeping the phine on the lens, so to solve this problem i bought a thick cover3) Battery life: Battery life is ok, I think this processor consumes more battery than snapdragon processor.Overall it is a very good phone at this price.

371,Value for Money,5,"I'm using it from around 2 months.Battery life and Fast charging are a big plus, easily can handle one full day with heavy usage.Performance is good, playing PUBG is good experience.Camera has decent performance. Low light issues are present.There are a lot of minor issues found.Like the copy,paste,select,select all tool bar doesn't show texts. Top scroll menu is not displayed sometimes when partly scrolled.Display is ok.Too many notifications from built in MI apps, can be muted though.Too many default apps, consumes some good space, still much space is available.Voice quality is good, ringtone is not very loud and sometimes is not heard, especially outdoors.Overall , keeping the day of my purchase in view, this is a good value for money.More options are now available under 15k now.Still this one stands as an option.",Dinesh, 26 February 2020

373,😋😋 As Powerful as Hulk 😋😋,3,"After using 16 days, i am writing this review.Pros:1. Powerful processor. You can play high graphics game without lagging.2. Display is pretty good ( as they mentioned that they provide HDR FHD+ Display). I have compared this with redmi note 7s (which is FHD+). Color reproduction is Better compared to redmi note 7s.3. Battery life is also good. It last for 1.5 day by normal using.4. Performance of back camera is good in day light condition. it takes pretty good pics both 64mp and normal camera.Cons:1. In low light condition both the cameras back and front takes noise pictures.2. Sometimes Selfie camera survives to detect the depth of the picture. The pictures looks noisy. (Waiting for the new update, by which they may resolve this issue.)2. Video quality is not good in 1080p 30 fps. This problem can be resolved by using the higher mode (1080p 60fps or 4k) of the camera. ( You can not using these mode all the time as it needs more storage).3. When playing high graphics game then the battery becomes very hot. (But the plus point is, it has liquid cooling system which helps to reduce the heat rapidly.) # If you are a gamer then it is the best mobile under 18k.",M. Sarkar, 13 November 2019

Above average camera pics + 64MP lens has some great detail capturing capabilities.3. No lag, whatsoever be.4. Halo White variant looks damn appealing, no match.5. Gaming is buttery smooth, be it COD or pubg.6. Iphone like gesture navigating through screens.7. Buttery smooth user interface.8. Dark mode is super cool.9.

Here is my review on it. 📷 camera quality is best, 64 MP captures great picture quality and out door (natural light) shots are fabulous.🔋Battery performance is Pretty Good, If you are a heavy user then it heats lil bit i.e if play pubg for long it heats up lil bit.Over-all battery performance is good and long lasting.☝️ Fingerprint scanner is way too good. unlocks your device at eye blink time🔥.",pranit, 1 June 2020

383,Good budget mid-range phone,4,Honest review after using it for 2 months.The phone is however good at this price range but still the performance is not up to mark. The pubg or other sich heavy games runs good but after 30 min the phone suddenly heats up and gets you to the home directly. The phone hangs too. Despite of this the display is so weak. Battery is good enough for a day use. Camera is made for the pro users. The pictures I have shared are clicked in pro mode. You may go with the phone if you are not a phone addict and have minimum usage.,Prakhar Singh, 23 January 2020

385,Things you'd wanna know before buying the Redmi note 8 pro,4,"Fingerprint sensor is responsive only for a while, therefore you'd need to register it on regular basis and it's definitely frustrating.Battery life is good but it depends on user, me being a gaming intensive user the battery last for a good 3 to 4 hours.Camera is good but I would recommend getting Google camera installed cause it's better than the stock camera app.",Sunep, 5 December 2020
386,Its a fantastic phone for this price...,4,"The phone is good , I will mark it as 8/10. Has fantastic rear camera and touch . Good battery life and has gaming experience .. the front camera is sub normal and lil disappointing. The finger print is also not that satisfactory. Has almost all featured similar to pro max 9.. I will suggest u to buy this phone who play lot of games and expect good battery life. Over all I will give 4 stars.",Dr.NINAD, 28 June 2020
387,Beast of the budget segment,5,I have been using this phone since nearly 9 days now and i can assure everyone who is thinking of buying it to go for it. Yes the other brands give samoled display for the same price range but the processor this phone has is just awesome and the camera at the rear is super cool. I am a pubg player and it heats up normally as every other phone nothing above than that. It gives hdr plus ultra frames which is pretty awesome for a phone at this price range and i have attached some camera samples and nothing has been changed excpet some vignette that i added and the camera wins my heart everytime the outdoor photos are just excellent. And night mode is par excellence. The battery runs very easily for a day if used lightly and needs a charge in the evening after playing for nearly 2 hours of pubg. In love with this phone can't say anything other than just go for it! No questions to be asked😁,Prateek Kumar, 22 November 2019

389,Great and this price,5,"Reviewing exactly after month of useFingerprint is lighting fast and if placement could be differentiated from camera bump would have been better.Camera is good but gives too much artificial colour during lighting conditions.Slow motion video 120,240,960ps but 960 is limited to 10sec only.Gaming this is best of all for this phone if ur gamer the best midrange to go on.games could played upto hdr at high frame rates.Battery would come upto a day at moderate usage and 2 if light usage playing games at high setting drain battery. Could be optimised with updates make it good.Ads which is present but could be turned of from bloatwares and etc.Mui11 is pretty good which was updated a week ago.Alexa work well but eats battery silently without usage.But Google voice is better.Weight is around 200 but u don't feel though.Gorilla glass protection is added plus for the phone both front and back.Screen is something interesting totally different from other note series and about 6.53 inch.",Praveen kumar, 29 November 2019

391,Redmi Note 8 Pro... Stunning in looks. Awesome in performance. Unmatched in Price,5,"The Redmi Note 8 Pro surprised me. The delivery was pretty fast. Got it the very next day by 11 a.m. After unboxing, the phone had about 59% power and it lasted the whole day. The phone is extremely elegant in looks and feel. We selected the gamma green and its envying. The phone is just one day old and is being used by my wife.  The UI is very smooth ( but the in-built ads can be annoying sometimes).  The navigation is very smooth. I did play one game for a long time and did not find any lag or heating up issues. The camera is out of this world. Alexa is mind-blowing. FM Radio is equally good. The sound output is real. The video clarity is remarkable. It has separate dual nano sim slots and a dedicated slot for a memory card or expandable GBs. The silicon carry case is also of good quality.  I shall review this phone in detail at a later stage.",Manoj Warrier, 29 November 2019

But it's okay. No problemEverything  else is great👍😊",Rajkumar Sahukar, 8 July 2020
396,Good Buy,4,The phone is overall good for the price. The battery life is really nice and camera quality as well. But there are some minor issues I'm facing in my phone like the wallpaper which I set keeps changing and also whenever I open an App after sometime it just goes back to my home screen. Also the setting of sound & vibration which I set keeps changing. Except these small problems the phone is good.,Siddhi Chiplunkar, 5 July 2020
397,Real Champion,5,"Got it from Amazon after many tries in that flash sales but the product really satisfied me. Great cameras at this price. 64 mp shots, low light images are really good. I'm was a bit confused between Note 8 pro and realme xt but realme phones have very oversaturated and unrealistic image processing. But photos of this phone are really close to reality. Battery life is also very good. You can easily get 1 and half days battery. Charging speed is pretty decent. Fingerprint reader is very fast and accurate. Display is HDr supported. Performance is top notch. I have not noticed any lag or frame drops and multitasking is really smooth. Call quality and network reception is also good. The only con that I have noticed is during youtube video play colours sometimes appears odd. Hope it will be fixed very soon by software updates. Overall the phone is best in this price and it's more than value for money product. Don't be tensed, just go for it.",SINJON NATH, 2 December 2019
398,Nice,4,"The phone worked fine for the first 3 months. Then suddenly a popup of some invalid input started coming every 30s. It got very disturbing. This problem lasted for some weeks and then stopped. Again when I did the software update of the phone the problem started. Also if I updated any app the problem starts. This is the only con, and I'm really irritated by it. Otherwise the phone is really good. Great camera and performance. Battery life is also good.",Swarnali G., 31 May 2020

400,Best phone ever #redmi #mi,5,"The Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro is an upgrade over the Note 7 Pro in almost every count. At least on paper. In the real world, there is a boost in gaming performance and display quality while the added Alexa integration will be welcomed by some. The camera quality remains more or less the same despite a newer sensor, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Addressing a few burning issues, we initially concluded the Note 8 Pro might be overheating during longer gaming sessions. While the phone does run warmer than say the Realme 5 Pro, it doesn’t go beyond 50 degrees, which is what we consider overheating in smartphones. The battery life of the phone is just as good as its predecessor, despite a larger battery. By the looks of it, Xiaomi took a bold step by choosing to go with a MediaTek flagship SoC and it seems to have paid off. There’s no reason why shouldn’t buy the Redmi Note 8 Pro, save for the pesky ads in the UI.#redmi #mi",Bhavesh assudani, 6 November 2019
401,6 Months Reviews unbiased,5,"Awesome device ..... I'm lovin it. It's been more than 6 months I'm using it but still it feels like a new device.Gaming -Some Heating Issues are faced during Gaming but thanks to liquid cooling 😌😌, It helps to cool down very soon.Processor -When I was purchasing it, a was having a lil bit of doubt but G90T is very good at the price of 15k. It never felt me feel any type of lag in my device.🔋 Battery 🔋 -Can't say much about it 🤔🤔 but still it is nice. It easily last long for more than a day if there is no hard usage. But Battery Drainage increases while playing PUBG. But thanks to Fast Charging 😌😌. Fast Charging works wellCamera -Camera specifications are the best, say like a flagship device but the software need optimisation.",Dharmendra Kumar, 11 March 2020
402,Awesome phone under 18k - mid range segment,5,"After experiencing all features of this phone. I would suggest to buy this phone Redmi note 8 pro. Best phone in mid range segment. 18k bucks and you will have the best phone in your hand. Camera quality - front n back are awesome. Compared with iPhone 8 and one plus 6 camera. Far better picture quality than iphone n oneplus 6. Xiaomi manufactued a best phone for pubg lovers too. It's best for playing pubg, call of duty, free fire, Asphalt car racing. No lag issue. Good phone themes by Xiaomi. Good user interface, good processor. Plz don't compare this phone with ""one plus 7"". One plus comes under premium segment phones and redmi note 8 pro comes under mid range segment. So level of bench markings for both phones is different. I would suggest to go n buy this phone if your budget is maximum 20k. Thanks Amazon for super fast delivery.",PRAVEEN HAVALDAR, 23 January 2020

Software has too much bugs. Android pie. Play store doesnt work. Using mi store. And its good. Having large number of apps. Too much bloatware. I would be saying specs are great but feeling is bad.

407,The perfect value for money,5,"Been using the phone for 2 weeks and it's safe to say that it's worth your money. Performance being the strong point is top notch..no complaints here. Even the display being IPS is great too.Design is sleek and premium unlike previous redmi phones. For the temps it definitely heats (which the the primary concern since the day it was announced)...but its not an issue,definitely not...at least not in my unit and it is cool and stable when not gaming. What my concern was it's battery ,maybe the g90t is power hungry and 4500mah lasts almost a day..I wished it to last for the next half too. I hope redmi fix in an ota update 🤞, the 18watt charger comes as a life saver here, it was a must and thanks redmi for providing it in the box.....will update this review in the future after long term use....Is this phone worth your money 💰-YES...",Abhishek P., 11 November 2019
408,Best Flagship competitor at Rs15K,4,"Overall a great phone… ButThe cons being:Speaker Volume is just ok and not loud enough;Battery charging takes ~2hr (to charge 0 to 100);Heating issue occurs if you Game for over 3 hrs. continuously.Screen is good no complains, but Xiaomi should have tried to give an Amoled screen at this price (Vivo and Realme has).Pro: Otherwise the Camera, regular mobile performance and Gaming is comparable with flagship devices, and is top quality. It’s a steal for Rs 15K. Go and get it without a second thought, you cant ask for more at this price.",Ashwin Bhupal, 6 December 2019

410,"Large screen, good camera and quick charging",5,"Xiaomi  is upgrading the technology very fast in its smart phones. Large corning gorilla glass front screen and back body too. The Gamma green hues on the back give my phone an excellent look. The best mega pixel 64 quad camera on a smart phone gives you excellent quality pictures. One does not require the HDR mode that use to take ages to click. The large 4500 mAh battery is a boon too and lasts me more than a day. The 18W charger is responsible for quick charging of the battery. The best part is the 128 GB storage. I can now store plenty of apps, images and videos in the phone without having to bother about the space running out on my phone. It is an excellent buy and must buy phone. One negative is the Amazon Alexa feature that is too slow and not responsive at times. I have given it up for the time being.",Anurag Luthra, 20 December 2019
411,A deal with no regrets.,5,"Redmi Note 8Pro (6GB-64GB) @14999 INR is good deal.I'll try to cover all main highlights only;1-Camera: The Optimization (AI) works Quite well, No need to tap or set the level or brightness at the time of capturing. 64 MP capture lot of details. 1x , 2X , 0.6X wide angle shots Has been uploaded for reference. (*night mode is really suck)2- Performance- It's works good for multi-Tasking or High end games like PUBG Mobile or Call of duty Mobile.(*Sometimes hangs while multitasking and Pops thats this app is not working)3- Battery- Stands all day in a single charge with heavy use. (on high brightness).4- Build Quality- Not handy but these size is normal these days, Weight 200 gm is enough and little bit disappointing.Glass on back with curve design is good and colour is really impressive even in sunlight. It attracts.",Anis Raza, 15 February 2020
412,Overall good for performance and build quility only,4,"Performance, Display, build quality is very good. Overall experience is good with phone. Plus points you can get from other reviews.Phone heating issue is observe if camera is used for videos in couple of minutes. Also Camera photo clarity is worst in low light and artificial light. Camera photos many times gets over sharp and show very weird details on persons skin if we zoom the photos to check details which is far more different than reality. Gorilla glass 5 gets scratches on screen easily hence screen guard is must.",Nitin, 4 March 2020

I'm using this along with my Poco F1 and i can say that camera is exceptional.Multiple features such as 64MP and Slow motion with different FPS are great. Battery life is excellent and you can charge it quickly because of fast charging and big heavy charger provided by Redmi.Overall I'm very satisfied with purchase and with the way it is been delivered to me via Amazon. I do not generally review the products or write a fake review. I am using it and its super fun phone. Go for it without second thought.,Samrat B, 24 August 2020

429,Redmi note 8 pro review,4,"One the best phone in the price range, camera Clarity is good, performance is also good, the only draw back is if you play games for a longer period of time like for an hour there is a slight heating issue but it's not a huge prob, once you turn off the game the mobile cools down rapidly fast.Over all I prefer it it's one of a best phones in the market with these features under this price range. And has a good cooling system in the phone ..  people who need features camera n performance do go for it .. ,😁",Enzy, 8 November 2019
430,Good package with lots of bugs,3,"Using note 8 pro from last 10 days and till now not much satisfy with over all performance.Too bulky in weight. screen resolution never seem to SD even.Processing speed and processor was too good in this range that is only thing which attract.Sound was just okay, you can't expect much more from MI in this price range.Its touch is not responsive, means not smooth.Device hang while playing 4K or normal video.Let talk about so called 64MP camera, only one thing lots of issues with camera, must be fixed in upcoming updates,like sometimes hang, focus not accurate, loosing focus and images get blurred after click (even tried using tripod), getting error while image editing, pro option is not requires because it not working as pro.Till now didn't face any heating issue even while playing game or using camera.

Thanks",Santosh Pandey, 17 November 2019
432,Redmi Note 8 Pro,4,"Battery life is so good, Camera quality is also good that takes decent pictures.",homer benny, 14 August 2021
433,Best phone under 17K,4,"I am satisfied with the purchase. Good phone with ample features and decent camera quality at this price point. Fast charger is not that fast, it takes around 1 hour 45 mins for full charge. Battery backup has significantly improved after the update. Not happy with the ads recommendations from Mi, feeling of being spammed at your own cost. Otherwise, this is a very good choice as your primary phone.",harishanker, 16 August 2020
434,Best budget phone with good camera and smooth display,5,                    The media could not be loaded.                 well.. I am writing a review after using this 15 days.. Every thing is working fine.... Display is very bright and clear.. You can find very minimal difference  if you come po are this display to Amoled...I mainly record videos and do digital artworks...  It's video quality is fantastic and it record very high quality sound as well as screen is very smooth.. Previously I used realme3 which display was not sharp and also touch sensitivity is poor.. RN 8 pro's touch sensitivity is too good.. And  I can draw whatever I want flawlessly....Only cons is that even 4500 mah battery can't hold a day if I play pubg 3-4 hour.. If you play pubg 2 hour and use normally than it's battery will last up to a day or 1and a half day.. I think the reason could be a mediatech processer..Other than this is an awesome phone..,sourabh, 21 February 2020
435,"Too low volume on speaker, makes it a bad product",4,"Sound/volume is very low. Even if you boost its volume fully it's too low. If you wanna watch movie on Amazon prime turning on its speaker and the phone is right in front of you the volume is too low that you cannot enjoy. Anither point I have observed manyt one is that whenever I am on a conference internet call and if by chance you get a normal voice call in between whether I receive or decline it, after that the volume of the conference call gets too low that you cannot hear anything in speaker.",MG, 31 December 2019
436,Good phone with so so cameras,3,"It's a good mobile with following pros and consPro: Screen Size is good, display is nice and bright. Light sensor works good and changes brightness as per light conditions.Processor if smooth but not as swift as it could be.Battery will last full Day if used 4-5 Hours... for normal use it Will last 1and a half day.Memory card support. I have put a 64 GB card thereby getting a capacity of 6/128 @12400+550= 12950/- ....Cons:Selfie camera is good but all other cameras are satisfactory only It takes crispy images but not with sharp details rather does some make up kind of job.Night mode makes pic like painting not clear.Those who are in the fancy of 64 mega pixels should rethink...a camera with lesser mega pixel can do wonder ... this race of mega pixel is useless.A little bit heavier than usual... because it flaunts gorilla glass front and back...but this makes it sexy too.Overall I got 6/64 @12400 ... this is almost a look a like of one+..... At this budget...it's a good phone than Oppo or Vivo....even better than Samsung M30s.....",PRADEEP KUMAR, 1 March 2020
437,Fast and responsive. No regrets purchasing this product.,5,"No regrets on purchasing the mobile. Exchanged a real me 2 pro and got the additional discount using ICICI card.Have installed the Gcam to try the astrophotography mode and found it giving good results.Battery life is good lasts me 2 days on low usage, on days with heavy usage it lasted me around 20 hrs with power saving mode ON.No network issues seen with both jio and airtel Sim.Two quirks I saw post the update was we lost the option to set different ring tones and notification tones to the dual Sim's and the volume rocker does not show the ui intermittently.I have installed the poco launcher as I somehow don't like the mui launcher.Edit: Purchased a second unit of Same spec but of Gamma Green color. First one purchased in Dec 2019, no regrets and is still performing very well.",Shiva Kumar, 9 February 2020
438,Worth for money,4,"I'm writing this review from the same mobile , the ram management is not so good except that everything is superb",Sai varun , 21 June 2021
439,Definitely is worth the 16k.,5,"I've been using the phone for about a week now, the battery life is awesome, using Netflix, playing games and chatting throughout the day, the battery last about 30 to 33 hours. (Until it's completely drained out)Haven't experimented with the camera too much yet, but the output is pretty good, happy with it.Like I read in most reviews, I do slip up between the camera and the finger print reader, but getting used to it already. The phone is on the heavier side, already managed to sleep off with the phone in my hand and have it fall on my face! And yeah it hurt!!The volume output is not as loud as my precious phone but not a big deal. Love the dark mode feature! And the gamma green, more like a teal colour to my eyes is my favorite!",Joseph , 21 January 2020
440,most high performance midrange phone,5,"The Redmi Note series has become ubiquitous to high performance and good cameras, all under Rs 15,000. While there’s no telling if this price barrier will be breached next time, Xiaomi managed to pack in even more fire power and four cameras with the new Note 8 Pro without increasing the price of the entry variant. It’s the second Redmi Note Pro smartphone to launch in 2019 in India. If Realme and Samsung indeed put a dent in Xiaomi’s top spot in the Indian market, the Note 8 Pro is the company’s answer to snatch it back. But with so many options now in the mid-range segment, is the Redmi Note 8 Pro the best mid-range smartphone to buy right now",Ramjith, 13 June 2020

443,"best phone under 15k , great performance and 64mp camera",5,"i wanted this phone before diwali but quick delivery was not available, sed life for me tho i recieved it a day after diwali... the phone is awesome overall, yes you might get slower charging,heating issues while playing heavy games but they're not so problematic you can adjust.... also the quad camera is just a marketing term, just the main sensor and telephoto sensors are worthy, ultra wide and macro lens quality is bad enough to make you avoid using that slo mo works fine ... also we can try some unofficial builds/mods of Gcams in this device for great photos ...fingerprint reader is in a bit wrong place but fast enough, camera bump is noticeably large , battery life is equal to  phones having 4k mAh batteries under 20k (in order words back up is similar to phones having budget chipset and 4k mAh batteries) g90t consumes more power",Narayan, 18 December 2019
444,Best mobile in this price range...,4,"I'm writing this review after use of 1 year... Nice mobile... I didn't face any problem... Good camera quality, nice touch sensitive and good look . But battery is not long lasting.",shashi kumar, 2 April 2021
445,Great phone at pretty much affordable price,4,"So far the device redmi note 8 pro looks great at mid price range and i can definitely say that it's the bang on successor of redmi mote 8 pro ,this particular colour gamma green in love😍 with this colour.Camera performance so far it's excellent still lot more to capture at the endBattery performance so far pretty nice as it is giving a day backup easily with so many work done on my redmi note 8 pro.Back cover is pretty decent but the camera bump is not protected through that cover 0.5 star minus for cover thing",AS, 6 November 2019
446,Doing fast with a great processor with long life,5,Wow! Its so great working processor. The fingerprint is also too fast..to unlock . And the battery life was also huge ( easy to go out without charger cable and can use throughout the day). And its about using 1 year for phone didnt even struk till now. And its too good and fast to use.Camera quality was also good attracting.And i think this can be use for another 4years easily.,Karan, 12 May 2021
447,Best for Gaming,4,"The phone is best for gaming,  I hve a 8/128 config, most graphic games are running smooth like butter, the phone gets heated while in the game, but gets cooled off immediately once u are in the lobby, due to the liquid cooling.....not happy with the camera array thou......battery life is good as it is new, the charging and discharging will take a toll in time.....My verdict is go for it for current period as there is no other phone in this range as good as this.",Amit Surve, 23 January 2020

Speaker (ok) (3/5)Overall good phone with ok camera.Good performance, okay display, great design.But instead of glass back Xiaomi should provide normal polycarbonate with super amoled display (without in-display fingerprint sensor). Also instead of micro lense & megapixel they should provide little bit better 📷.",Tushar Bhosale, 23 January 2020
449,Best mobile with best performance,4,"Super mobile with best configuration. But more cost in price overall after one month of usage iam writing this review.Camera is ok ,when we switch to night mode it's super clarity. Ok but is is not like 64mp.

450,Paisa Wasool Handset,4,"This is one of the amazing handset from MI to their valuable clients with amazing specifications.Camera clarity is superb with different modes along with the speed of the multiple applications running at a same time is smooth and easy going.Just found 1 problem, while continuous video shoot from the handset in daylight, phone battery heats up, so bit worried about it or else I strongly recommend this phone for photography lovers, gamers and youtubers.At this price range it is giving a tough fight to Realme, Samsung, Vivo and Oppo",Saurabh Shah, 30 November 2019
451,Amazing phone in this price range :-D,5,"Everything is awesome in this phone. From gaming to multitasking, camera to battery, From UI to Display, everything is awesome. The camera quality is awesome, the fingerprint and face unlock are fast, and moving on to the gaming I just want to say that :- "" This phone is an absolute monster in this price range.""Coming to the looks it looks so cool and I've purchased halo white colour and this colour is amazingly awesome.The things which I've liked the most is that there is an IR blaster which works just fine, it often comes in handy. And the built-in Alexa is a bit annoying but fine.Overall if u want a decent phone for great camera quality, battery life and gaming performance then just go for it without a second thought!I think I've complimented so much about this phone but really it deserves that :-D",Rajan, 3 December 2019

Wide angle is super..Macro lens is perfect sample provided.Display is high dynamic range enabled it provides HDR mode in YouTube. Mediatek helio g90t it is really amazing how Mediatek changed the game.In the segment Redmi note 8 pro has highest antutu benchmark scores really worth it.no lags even played pubg and asphalt 9 in high quality heating is normal but i realised it cools quickly as it built with Liquid cool technology.Battery is 4500 mAh got approximately one day and 12 hours after moderate use.. pretty nice backup.18 watts fast charger is really helpful in busy times..it charges 60% in an hour.Other cool features includes Amazon alexa,IR remote, dedicated SD card slot and more in MIUI11.",Abhishek R, 10 January 2020
455,Great phone at this Price Range,5,"Phone design and look is wonderful. Back glass in Green gives a great look and i really loved it.Rear camera is really great. Dark mode is a extra good thing to note. No heating issues in this 3 days of using. Battery is good. Takes 2 hrs to complete 1 to100% . Memory and RAM is great advantage at this price segment.Cons found as per my view isAutio output for music have little echo and over bassEven after turning bass level to 0, bass sound is heard.Auto brightness doesn't seems right. Even for  a little shadow the brightness level get much down.Front camera quality is not great. Brightness exposure is little high.Overall its a great phone at this price level. Go for it. Same Memory and RAM variants price are higher in other brands.",Vinoth v., 24 December 2019

The camera works well....once again i want to u tell you that the interface is quiet fantastic...but the weight of the mobile is 200 gms which is a bit annoying me...The dark mode is one of the best things in this mobile...There os no lagging even with the MI skin on the android OS which is a relief for the users when compared to other brands...This product is woth buying in 17k price..,venkat, 22 June 2020
459,What a Joke for 64 MP camera,4,i ordered Gamma green 6/128 varient.Look is superb.glassy back gives a perfection to its look.every thing can be said Great under this price.i purchased it for its 64 MP Camera.why companies are on RAT-RACE for increasing Numers of camera and its MPs? numbers of cameras and MPs are increasing day by day and quality is decreasing.it took upto 25mb pic with 9k×6k resolution.but pic starts blurring after zooming.Samsung M 30s 48 MP camera's pic were far batter than its 64 MP.Why companies claiming for snapping high resolution pic? front camera was good in low light.,Sarla, 11 November 2019
460,Nice phone at this price,4,pros:* Phone looks awesome and premium. I bought the electric blue one and it's the best among all other colours.* Charging is really really fast.* Finger print sensor & Face unlock is good. Not awesome.* Lots of useful features.Cons:* It has a serious disturbance in hotspot sharing. Continuously an extra device gets connected & disconnected while the hotspot is on in the device.* Sometimes the phone gets hanged while multitasking.,Deep, 7 March 2020
461,Battery Monster & Powerful Performance,5,"Very nice phone from Redmi. After using it for around 10 days,  I am writing this review.Till now battery life is very good, it lasts for 2 days on very good use of Facebook, whatsapp and other apps.Cons :1) Very Good battery life2) Fast Performance3) Fast Charging almost within 2 hours, full charge from 0 to 100.4) Good front camera for selfie, and Decent rear camera.5) No heating issue, while heavy internet surfing.6) AI enabled camera features.Prons1) Main camera of 64 mpx, could be better. Megapixels in phone is just a number, Picture quality is almost equals to 20 Mega pixels, still convincing.2) Little heavy in weight almost 200 gm .3) Pre installed with some unuseful apps, some of them can be removed.",Aditya Kumar Srivastava, 1 February 2020
462,All in one.. Nice device,5,"Super it's an upgrade of previous note phone with more camera and larger screen and a bit faster processor. Rest things are same as I m already using note 6 pro.One problem will come when you try to share hotspot, it will not be visible in laptop but in other mobile or tablet it will show. So to remove this problem simply reset the WiFi Bluetooth and then start your hotspot, it start working. Macro shot are good but you need to be very stable to take pics. Rest it's a superb device considering the price range. And lastly I am lover of mi product so I started my phone from note 3 to still waiting for 10 😊 . It's cost me around 12k (6gb 64gb) in Big saving deal. Thanks Amaz for early delivery",Birendra Kumar, 25 January 2020

468,Beast,5,Best phone under this price range....Their are heating issue which i think is after a heavy usage...Mediatek chip which defines the heating issue... But with liquid cooling it keeps it under control....Camera is pretty decent but..obviously the advertisement and other promotion just makes it too spectacular which is not the case...You cant judge it untill you try it... As i compared which my frnds one plus device note 8 pro got much better quality pictures in certain areas...Overall its a beast under this price range...I wouldn't even think of realme X2 instead of this ... As the performance much better in note 8 pro.... And other than that the price is much better .... In the price which i got 6gb 128gb ... My friend added 1000 more to get 6gb 64gb varient...,shiljo safal, 14 January 2020

Moving from iPhone was not easy but this is pretty good feature wise in the amount purchased.Phone is overall good in every aspect. Though I am not very techy but still till now I dont find any glitch in the phone.Best part is its processing speed. I also like its camera quality and display as well.Only thing is its a bit heavy device . Rest all is perfect.Updated Review:This part I am writing after using Redmi for than a year. Still there is no issue and hardware n software r working well. Ican say till date this is the best phone i have used even better than iPhone.

470,Redmi Note 8 Pro,4,"The phone is excellent in all respect, especially the camera quality is worth mentioning. Photos are crisp and carry all the details. Only issue with this phone is the sound, which i think is a bit low in respect of audacity. During a call, especially in a crowded area, one has to make all out effort to listen to the person on other side of phone. The sound should have been a bit more. Otherwise the phone has all the good things.",abrar ahmad siddique, 10 January 2020

It's ok now. But as I complained none from company made contact nor responded as the call was made by me just after 10 minute of delivery . This made me quite disappointed.This was for the first time I purchased a mobile worth so,online, this should not happened again.I hope so. Body is sleek & stylish,quite heavier in weight.

476,Best for gaming as compared to note 9 pro,4,I saw that some people are complaining about the display but the display is very clear and crisp and if you are a pubg player then definitely go for it average fps is 56 if you have AC in your house cause it has some heating. And don't do recording cause it effecs the fps.... If you are confused b/w note 9 pro and 8 pro then go for 8pro,Sombit dutta, 4 June 2020

The audio quality is also good.",Amazon Customer, 29 January 2020
478,Great phone except the battery,4,Excellent phone for this price range. Touch experience is nice and camera is superb. Camera has lot to offer and you can take superb quality pics. Macro pics and portraits are also great and have good charity and good details. Processor speed is also good and I don't had any problems while playing games or using heavy applications. One key area which needs improvement is the battery backup. Battery gets discharged within a day itself which is discouraging.,Amazon Customer, 4 February 2020
479,Thumbs up for this,4,Using this device from more than 10 days.No doubt it is worth to buy this device as if you're sort of heavy user RAM management is amazing and I'm using 8/128GB variant.In terms of rear camera it is one of the best device at this price point but front camera is bit noisy I can say.Battery life is just excellent!!! As I'm a very heavy user this device lasts for one day easily.Overall it is power packed device,Rahul Chhanesh, 7 February 2020

481,Loving it !,5,I upgraded from note 4 so changes are definitely noticeable1.) Yes there are some features which xiaomi should have implemented.But overall this device has an edge over competitors2.)Camera is good but ppi is low which makes photos look average and xiaomi intentionally hold back there cameras using software to help their flagships but i am not a camera guy so i am fine with it.3.) Can handle basically any game and few large apps at a time. I haven't played much games thou4.) MIUI !!! ads can be disabled and nobody uses mi browser or bloat apps anyway.5.) Battery and fast charge are excellent(20w vooc is little better)6.) Amoled is missing but IR blaster is more helpful than vibrant colors.7.) Back fingerprint reader is faster than in-display in this range.overall a great experience,Rajdeep S., 17 November 2019

485,Good But Little Disappointed.,4,"Packaging Was Not Good , It Should Look Better But I Was Disappointed.Overall Mobile Phone Is Good And I liked Its Performance, But I Also Felt That They Have Given A Used Phone, Because In Settings- In Battery Usage Section It was Mentioned That The Last Charge Time Was 48 min ago . And I Have Seen This At The Time Of Configuration Of The Phone. This Means They Have Given Renewed Phone To Me.Also Camera Is Good But Not Very Good.",Hemant Singh, 24 December 2019

490,Good phone with all aspects covered at less budget.,5,"Honest review after using heavily with note 8 pro.Pros:1) Camera picture quality with good light settings delivers hq images.2) No heating issues as others mentioned. Did ping for 3 hours. I had a phone case covered dint notice any heat.3) Battery life lasts for 2 days without much gaming. With heavy usage it will be one day..4) phone call, network quality is great. Value for moneyCons:1) Phone is heavy, making it carry uncomfortable to hold for messaging and other purpose. Let down. Heavier compared to previous version.2) Speaker and head phone jack kept at the bottom. While gaming, you tend to cover the speaker with your hands. Head phone jack could have kept at the top.3) Low light camera doesn't offer good quality.4) Big phone and uncomfortable to carry in pant pockets.",Sridhar T, 6 December 2019
491,Definitely worth purchase !,4,"This phone is a mixture of smart camera or I should say cameras (set of 4 cameras is no joke), has got quick charge support, and if you're looking a phone for hardcore Gaming at this price range, then don't think even for a second, just grab this deal, Note 8 Pro is equipped with its own special features to boost your gaming experience and has console level graphics support. It also has large screen display, comes with Android 9 Pie and Inbuilt Amazon Alexa is definitely worth a try.",Amazon Customer, 22 November 2019

494,Under 15k is totally worth it...!,5,"All said and done, Redmi Note 8 Pro is an impressive device and offers great value for money at its selling price. It raises the performance bar in the 15-20K category courtesy of its unlikely hero, the Mediatek Helio G90T SoC. The system and graphics performance are excellent at this price point and probably the best you can get with any chipset south of the Snapdragon 845. The photography department is more than decent and can get even better if some of the chinks are ironed out through software updates. While I had the 6GB variant.But to state it simply, the Redmi Note 8 Pro is better than the Realme XT in terms of sheer performance, gaming included. Their cameras are evenly matched in terms of specifications and image quality both, and so are their aesthetics.",Jatin ✔️, 16 January 2020
495,Excellent phone,4,The phone is very good and one of the best phone under 18k and you can also compare by Samsung m31 and this phone and the camera is excellent.The battery need to be a little better but still the battery life can be increased if we take certain measures and gaming in this phone is excellent so you can buy this phone.,Mogul, 30 July 2020
496,Hanging,3,"When calling, the phone hangs.  After sometime the phone gets disconnected and comes through the network.",Amazon Customer, 18 November 2021
497,Phone is very good and battery is awesome too.,5,"Pros::- The phone has quite smooth scrolling and no lag even when I've opened multiple apps.- The picture quality is good as well. For night mode we have to adjust few settings and we can get good quality pix as well. One can use GCAM as well for more functionality.- Second space is also quite useful.- The phone is now updated to MIUI 12.x, so it's much better.Cons::- The phone can be a bit big and bulky to hold- The fingerprint doesn't recognize my left fingers for fingerprint scan",Customer, 15 September 2020
498,Beast performance but not that beast overall,4,The performance of this phone is unmatched with any other phone in this price range but the main problem is with battery life it drains out completely in half day with mediun usageThe camera quality is not good for low light and indoor photography the 64mp is good fingerprint reader is also fastThe phone has some heating issue i hope th mi team will improve it,Hormazd Patel, 17 June 2020
